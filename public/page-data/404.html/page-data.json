Sometimes you see the signals and know precisely what is going on, and sometimes you wonder what just happened.\n\n**If the dog looks over the bridge of the nose held down, the situation is serious. He is now seriously prepared to face a conflict.**\n\nThis means for the dog owner to pay attention and de-escalate the situation. You can do that by turning around and calling your dog, i.e. putting distance between your dog and whatever made him get serious.\n\n**If the dog looks up at someone and the bridge of your nose stays up, it is a sign of insecurity.**\n\nThe eye contact with the other dog should be interrupted so that the uncertainty of the dog is not increased. \n\nIf eye contact is maintained too long, sensitive dogs, in particular, could feel threatened. \n\nOn the one hand, this can lead to the dog feeling so cornered that it starts an attack. On the other hand, it can also lead to the dog losing confidence, feeling more and more insecure.\n\n## Aggressive Dog Body Language\n\n* The dog is looking at someone with a lowered nose bridge.\n* Ears are up and forward\n* The dog is making himself look bigger\n* His tail is high and rigid\n* The hackles are up\n* His body weight is forward and ready to lunge\n* He will be staring directly at his opponent\n* Teeth are exposed by a vertically top raised lip, and the nose is wrinkled\n* The dog might be growling, snarling or low pitched barking\n\n## Signs A Dog Is Scared - Fearful Dog Body Language\n\n* The dog is looking at someone with high held nose bridge.\n* The eyes are wide and rounded, and you can see the white part of the eyeball. A fearful dog will most likely look away from you or the other dog. \n* The dog leans his weight on the slightly lowered hind legs, with the shoulder area somewhat lowered and the head stretched forward. This weight distribution makes the dog look smaller and allows it to escape more quickly.\n* The more insecure or submissive a dog is, the more it bends his back and makes a kind of hump.\n* When a dog raises his hackles is a sign of insecurity or excitement. \n* If you meet an insecure dog, you should not seek direct eye contact. In prolonged eye contact, he recognises a threat and would become even more insecure. He can lash out, bark, jump even bite if the dog feels cornered. \n\n## Sign Of A Confident Dog\n\n* The self-confident dog shifts his weight to the straight front legs. Thereby he holds his head straight up and in the direction of his interest and lowers the muzzle slightly. The tail is carried horizontally, at most slightly raised, the back is straight.#\n* If the dog is self-confident, impresses or threatens, it keeps its back all the more straight and pushes its limbs stiffly through.\n\n\n## Dog Posture Meaning\n\nBy learning and observing your dog, you will see that he is continuously telling you exactly how he feels and what his intentions are. \nYou just have to know what to look for and be able to interpret it.\n\nBy learning your dog's posture, meaning and language, you will be able to notice little signs of stress, anger or confusion when they occur.  You can now adjust your behaviour (and other's) to trigger aggression or any distress caused to your dog.\n\nA bond with your dog is a two-way relationship, based on trust, love, respect and two-way communication and understanding. \n\nYour dog is continuously watching and learning all he can about you, adjusting his behaviour at times to suit what he sees. It's only fair that you do the same towards him.\n\nTrust, respect, love & communication. \n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team\n"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-12-06T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

It is a slow way to move forward. A younger or adult dog uses walking pace only for a short period of times. Mostly it is used by elderly or sick dogs.\n\n\n## Stalking\n\n\nStalking is shown by a dog either shortly before he attacks or lunges after the prey. It can be part of playtime as well. \n\n\nThe dog will lower his head to be in line with his back, focuses and stalks his opponent. This action is followed by either a fake attack or a heavy body contact play. \n\n\n## Trotting\n\n\nIt is the most preferred way of moving forward for a healthy adult dog. \n\n\nThe diagonal legs (front and back) will lift from the ground at the same time. In between the dog floats above the ground. \n\n\n### Side Trotting\n\n\nThe legs on the same side will be lifted at the same time from the ground. \n\n\nThis way of trotting is used by dogs:\n* that are very tired, since it is a very energy-saving way of moving\n* that have issues with their back or their gate\n\n\nSometimes dogs use this type of movement because their human is to fast for their walking pace, but too slow for their regular trotting. Used if the dog has to walk for an extended period on the leash with their human. \n\n\n### Imposing Trotting\n\nAn elegant looking trot used to impose on other dogs or humans. \n\nFeatures of imposing trotting:\n\n* The steps the dog takes are bouncy\n* his body is raised, chest broadened\n* his tail is raised up high\n* his ears are forward towards the person or dog he is imposing on\n\n## Gallop\n\nThis is the fastest way a dog can move. We distinguish between an imposing gallop and a chasing gallop. \n\n### Imposing Gallop\n\nThe imposing gallop is used by the dog in a fake attack while playing. The dog looks like he is hopping like a bunny towards his play partner.  \n\nFeatures of the imposing gallop:\n* his back is straight\n* his tail is up high\n* he is pounding the ground with his front legs\n\n### Chasing gallop\n\nThe dog uses this type of movement when he is chasing after prey. This is the fastest way a dog can move forward. \n\nFeatures of chasing gallop:\n* front legs stretch far to the front, the hind legs will firmly push into the ground to send the dog as far forward as possible\n* the tail is raised on the same hight as the back\n* the head is also held at the same hight as the back\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-11-22T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

It indicates thereby, first of all, only excitement. This excitement can be of joyful nature, but also a threatening gesture.\n\nIf you are aware of the many meanings of the tail wagging, you will also understand the difficulty in communicating a tail docked dog has. It is hardly possible for him to communicate with his stunted tail tip. \n\nFurthermore, such dogs are often misunderstood by other dogs without being aware of the problem themselves. To the other dog, it looks as if the dog is retracting its tail, even if he is threatening, for example.\n\n## Tail Wagging - Quick Tail Wagging \n\nFast wagging is a sign of excitement or tension. The quicker the dog is wagging his tail, the higher his state of excitement. \n\n\nA dog with a long tail will wag more widely and more slowly. A dog with a short tail, on the other hand, will move back and forth very quickly and briefly, almost even vibrate. \n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Slow Tail Wagging With The Tip Of the Tail\n\n\nThe dog shows this type of tail wagging as a reaction to attention he is given or the return of his family members. \n\n\nIt can also express a friendly and appeasing mood towards the higher ranking dog. Puppies show this waving almost exclusively when greeting their parents.\n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Vibrating Tail Wagging With The Tip Of the Tail\n\n\nThe dog shows this type of tail wagging when he meets a competitor. The two dogs circle around each other and assess the strength and intentions of the other.\n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Swinging Tail Wagging\n\n\nWhen a dog shows a swinging tail wagging, the tail swings slightly side to side. Thereby the head is somewhat lowered, and the dog stares at the opposite person or dog. This behaviour is a threatening one. The dog threatens the opponent to start an attack if he comes towards him now.\n\n\n## Tail Wagging - One-Sided Tail Wagging\n\n\nThe dog can also wag strongly to one side only. This behaviour can be seen, for example, when a dog stands next to a human. \n\n\nIf the dog increasingly waves in the direction of the human. The human is perfumed with the scent of the dog, so to say the dog is marking his human.\n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Wide Tail Wagging\n\n\nThe broad waving is not threatening but friendly and is a sign that the dog is doing well. It is often shown during the play, where it is supported by growling and barking. The sounds are not a sign of relaxation, though. \n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Wide In Form Of 8 Tail Wagging\n\n\nThe dog shows the broad tail wagging in the shape of an eight only at the most vigorous excitement! This wagging can be seen, for example, when a sexually active male dog meets a lady. \n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Wide Tail Wagging With Hip Movement\n\n\nThe dog shows this very friendly tail wagging when he greets another friendly dog or his family. The more the dog lowers its backside, the more excited it is. This submissive wagging is often supported by hectic licking or licking into the air. The dog’s head is lowered and slightly turned to the side.\n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Slow Tail Wagging With Lowered Tail\n\n\nAs long as the tail is neither high nor low, but slightly lowered, the dog shows insecurity about the situation or uncertainty about his own actions. As soon as the uncertainty subsides or increases strongly, he will raise or lower his tail again.\n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Showing Downwards\n\n\nA dog with a loose, downward hanging tail gives a signal for calmness and relaxation. The dog stands loose and relaxed with its weight on all four paws, its attention is not directed in any particular direction.\n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Is Loosely Parallel To The Ground Without Movement\n\n\nThe dog shows attention. This is the position he shows, for example, when a person approaches or when he hears a sound that attracts his attention. Both the arrival of the person and the sound are not considered threatening by him.\n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Is Rigidly Parallel To The Ground Without Movement\n\n\nThe rigid tail indicates increased alert and/or aggression, e.g. when foreign dogs approach. Even in competitive situations, dogs signal their mood until the situation is resolved.\n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Is Upright Slightly Curved Over The Back\n\n\nThis dog shows imposing behaviour, which is expressed by the tail being curved or bent over his back. A dog shows this posture, for example, when it meets a competitor. He does not want to embarrass himself in front of the other dog. Still, he does not yet assess the situation as seriously threatening.\n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Is Completely Curved Over The Back\n\n\nThis dog does not expect any threat, on the contrary, he is self-confident. \n\n\nThe tail completely curved over the back can be a sign of absolute social security. Some dogs often enough overplay their insecurity in a particular situation by pretending a strong presence. \n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Is Completely Lowered And Somewhat Pinched Between The Legs\n\n\nIf the hind legs are stretched, this position signals psychological stress, pain or illness. \n\n\nIf the hind legs are bent, and the hips are lowered, this position signals that the dog is insecure, shows fear or worry. \n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Is Completely Pinched Between The Legs\n\n\nThe deeper the dog holds the tail and the more he clamps it between his hind legs, the more uncertain he is. \n\n\nThis position is taken by dogs that want to show as less presence as possible to make it clear to the other dog that they do not wish to provoke them.\n\n\nThis posture is also an essential signal for appeasement.\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-11-08T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

Language","postSlug":"dog-posture-meaning-dog-body-language","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"\nHow a dog positions his body and what type of body positions he adopts is also paramount for the communication towards us humans as well as towards other dogs.\n\n## The T-Position Dog Body Language \n\nThe T-position is an active territorial limitation of the opposite dog, where one dog stands in the way of the other, crossing his path so to speak. \n\nTwo dogs meet each other, sniff each other, turn in circles until one, more active dog overtakes the other and stands dominantly crosswise in front of him. \n\nIn such situations, dog owners should leave in opposite directions quickly but not hectically, to de-escalate the situation. \n\nIf the other dog does not accept the dominant position of the first dog, he can show this by ignorance and pass the rear of the first dog. \n\nIf the oppressed dog shows himself submissive towards the dominant one, e.g. by turning its head or even its whole body away, the situation can also relax, as this has been clarified first.\n\n## Relaxed Dog Body Language \n\nTo understand all the different meanings of your dog’s body language, you first have to recognise and understand what your dog looks like in a relaxed state. \n\nThese are the features of a relaxed dog:\n* he stands on his all four paws with slightly bent hind legs\n* his head is slightly raised\n* his muzzle is somewhat open, and you can see a little bit of his tongue\n* his tail is lowered and relaxed\n* his ears are positioned slightly to the front side of his head\n\n## Alert Dog Body Language \n\nThese are the features of an alert dog:\n* his head is raised and somewhat tilted forward\n* his weight is slightly shifted forward\n* his ears are turned forward\n* his eyes are open and attentive\n* his muzzle is closed \n* his tail is relatively parallel to the ground and moves side to side\n\n## Playful Dog Body Language \n\nThese are the features of a playful dog:\n\n* typical gesture for playfulness is the lowered front part of the body, where the front legs almost completely touch the ground\n* his tail is broadly moving and is held up high\n* his ears are up and to the front\n* his eyes are wide open\n* his muzzle is open, and his tongue is well visible\n* your dog can let out a high pitched bark to round the entire invitation to play up\n* during play the dog will change body postures quickly\n\n## Imposing Dog Body Language \n\nThere are several ways a dog is imposing: \n* marking\n* humping\n* putting his paws on top of the other dog/human\n* t-positioning\n\nBut in addition to the features mentioned above, a dog can also use the following body language to impose:\n* he is standing stiff on his all four legs\n* he is raising his head and pushing his chest forward and up as well with the intention to make himself look bigger\n* his tail is up, wagging slowly from one side to the other\n* his ears show forward\n* his eyes might be averting from his opponent since imposing doesn’t always have to be of an aggressive nature\n\n## Offensive Threatening Dog Body Language \n\nThe attitude in the offensive threat is similar to the imposing body posture.\n\nThese are the features of an offensive threatening dog:\n* the dog stands stiff-legged and slightly tilted forward\n* his head is slightly lowered, so that head and back form a line\n* the facial expression is characterised by short, rounded mouth angles, which are raised towards the front\n* the ears are directed forward, and the opponent is possibly also fixed growling\n* his neck whithers are raised\n* his tail is raised above the backline, the tail hairs may also be raised\n* the tail is stiff, but it can also vibrate slightly\n* shortly before an attack, a snarling may occur\n\nThe more insecure the dog is in this situation, the longer the mouth angles are pulled backwards. \n\n## Defensive Threatening Dog Body Language \n\nAnother dog can respond to an offensive threat with a defensive threat. \nThese are the features of a defensive threatening dog:\n* the dog’s hind legs are slightly bent, aiming for a shrinking of the body\n* his tail is lowered and pinched between his hind legs\n* he is putting the ears back\n* the corners of the mouth are pulled back long and pointed\n* the teeth are bared over the entire mouth area, that much that the molars and gums are also visible\n* he is biting in the air\n* the dog can even scream, growl or bark.\n\n## Submissive Dog Body Language \n\nSubmission is when a lower-ranking animal submits to a higher ranking one. \n\nThese are the features of a submissive dog:\n* the dog is making himself smaller\n* he is lowering his head to the ground, beginning to crawl or lying on its back\n\nThis behaviour can dampen the aggression of other dogs, as the reduced, infantile body posture of the dog makes the other dog understand that no danger emanates from him. \n\nHowever, the opponent may also feel so disturbed by the mere presence of the other dog that submissive behaviour is not sufficient to stop the aggression.\n\n### Active Submissive Dog Body Language \n\nThe active submission starts from the submissive animal itself. \n\nThe lower-ranking dog is also tense, but approaches the higher ranking dog and tries to calm him down actively by licking the corners of his mouth or lifting his paw to calm him down. \n\nEye contact is not avoided - as in passive submission - but short and indirect eye contacts are made. The dog reduces his height. \n\n### Passive Submissive Dog Body Language \n\nIn this case, the other dog submits completely, lies on its back and does not dare to move in the slightest. \n\nThe dog in this position behaves completely calm, quiet and passive.\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-10-25T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

Under his lips, he has a powerful jaw with different types of teeth. \n\nThe dark colour of his lips is in contrast with not only his fur but also his teeth and dark colour of the inside of his mouth.\n\nAs a warning and precursor of intense aggression, the dog pulls his lips up, in the process, he may growl and frown. Matching the facial expressions, the body language is, of course, also under tension.\n\n* If a dog is insecure and submissive, he will only pull his mouth backwards and shows its teeth only when the insecurity is coupled with aggressiveness.\n* \n* If a dog feels sure about his actions, the mouth is drawn forward. Also, here the dog shows its teeth additionally only if aggression is involved. Here, however, the showing of teeth also refers only to the front incisors and canines.\n\n## Why Do Dogs Lick Their Lips?\n\nLet’s start with the natural, obvious answer: your dog sniffed out the chicken, and since he likes it, he will lick his lips to signalise that. \n\nThe more hidden meaning of lips licking is that the dog is showing you he is stressed. This behaviour is also accompanied by a submissive body posture. \n\n## Why Do Dogs Yawn?\n\nThe natural answer is he might be sleepy, or he just woke up — a sign of being tired. \n\nThe more subtle meaning is that your dog is releasing tension after coming out from a stressed or confusing situation.\n\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-10-11T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

They are almost fixated on things that move. \n\nIn a dense blanket of leaves in the forest, your dog does not perceive each leaf as we do. For him, the whole thing actually seems more like a surface. But he registers every little movement within this surface.\n\n\nThe fact that a dog is so strongly fixated on movement tells me that in training, it is always necessary to work with body language signals such as hand signals. \n\n\nThe dog has a much wider field of vision than humans: 270° compared to 200° in humans. Therefore dogs can detect the slightest movement in an extensive area. \n\n\nDogs are worse at estimating distances correctly. This is related to the overlap degree between the individual fields of vision: 60° for dogs and 120° for humans. Humans can also switch better between near and far vision than dogs, thanks to having a bigger lens build in. :-)\n\n\nA dog is not on the same eye level as a human being. This means that dogs, due to their lower body height, cannot see their surroundings as well as we humans can. \n\n\nThe person behind the hedge can only be seen by the dog after he has passed the hedge. You, as the person walking with your dog, should be aware of such situations. In such sudden encounters, the dog can get scared, frightened and/or react aggressively.\n\n\nWith their eyes, dogs can indicate almost all moods. They are an essential part of facial expressions. \n\n\nA dog’s gaze can be stiff, rigid, threatening, warm, demanding, fixating or fearful, to name just a few examples. The eyes can change size becoming bigger or smaller. Besides, each dog has a very individual eye shape, so there are dogs with round and dogs with almond-shaped eyes.\n\n\n## Dog Eye Language - Dog Facial Expressions\n\n\n* If a dog is in an aggressive mood, it pulls the eyebrow region together, downwards against the bridge of the nose. \n* If a dog is frightened or submissive, it pulls it upwards against the temples.\n* If a dog sees something exciting or frightening, his pupils dilate. Same also happens if a dog is happy. \n* If a dog is tired or sleepy, then his pupils will get smaller.\n* If a dog directs his gaze directly and for a long time at another dog, this is to be understood as a sign of provocation or threat.\n* Submissiveness, restraint, peace seeker are signalled with an averted gaze, which can also be supported by blinking.\n* For the subordinate members of the pack, it is essential to continually observe higher ranking animals to check out their mood. This attentive look is only of short duration.\n* A gaze that lasts longer than two seconds can be dominant or a sign of a self-assured threat, This action is also backed up by threatening signals displayed by the rest of the body.\n* If a dog stares at a human being, he sometimes does so only out of pure interest, out of joy, out of anxious expectation, because we might just be telling him something. Look at the big picture and context of the situation.\n\n## Dog Posture Meaning - Dog Forehead Body Language\n\n\n* Frowning is a signal of aggression or insecurity. Please notice the rest of your dog’s body language. See the context, see the big picture. \n* If a dog shows submissiveness, it pulls its forehead very smoothly with its ears backwards, the eyes appear large and round, the ears are laid back.\n\n\n## What Colours Can Dogs See?\n\nSince dogs and their ancestors are most active at dawn and dusk, e.g. in search of prey, the eye performance of day-active humans differs considerably from theirs. \n\nThe cones inside our eyes are responsible for the colour vision. Humans have three different cone types for the colours red, green and blue. The brain then forms the overall colour impression of the colour information from the cones. \n\nDogs, however, only have two different types of cones, they lack cones for the colour red. Therefore the dog cannot recognise the colour red. \n\nThe dog’s colour vision is therefore roughly comparable to that of a person with red-green blindness. This information should be explicitly used in training. \n\nFor example, if the dog is to use its nose when it is supposed to look for a ball in a meadow, it makes sense to choose a red ball. The dog can hardly make out this ball in the green field with his eyes. \n\nIf, however, your dog needs to find the ball quickly, it is better to choose a blue ball, as he can immediately perceive it as a blue point in the green field.\n\n## Can Dogs See In The Dark?\n\nDogs have a light-reflecting layer on the back of their eyes, called *tapetum lucidum*. Because of the reflection, the light falls a second time on the cones inside the dog’s eyes, which is why he can see better in the dark than humans.\n\nIn principle, the dog’s eyes do not function significantly different from those of humans. Light enters through the pupil and is directed by the lens onto the retina. The retina transmits commands to the brain via the optical nerve. \n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-09-27T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?
