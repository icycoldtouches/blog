If your puppy gets tired, it’s time to stop the activity that you are doing.\n\nThe processing of stimuli is mainly done during sleep. To be able to dose properly your puppy’s training it is therefore important that you recognise the fatigue signals of your young dog.\n\nThere are several things that you can see when a puppy gets tired. Mimic is one of them.\nIf you look at the face of your puppy, you can look at the eyes, ears and mouth.\n\n## The Mouth\n\nWhen we start with the mouth then you can notice that a puppy is starting to get tired or starts getting warm because because of the panting. \n\nThe mouth opens slightly with the corners of the mouth pulled slightly backwards.\nOn the mouth you can notice even more fatigue. The puppy will bite harder or more when he gets tired. All pups bite, but when a pup gets tired, the intensity and frequency can increase.\n\n## The Ears\n\nYou can also read a lot of information on the ears of your puppy. Tired puppies let their ears hang slightly on the side of their head.\n \nThis happens with hanging ears as well as with standing ears. The ears then seem to hang a little ‘Half stick’.\n\n## The Eyes\n\nPuppy’s eyes always provide information. When tired, the eyes may turn a little red. \nThe lower eyelids of the dogs that are looser in their skin can hang down a bit (especially with the larger breeds).\n\nThe look of a puppy will change. When a puppy realises that he is tired and he is able to find its peace, you will see that it has half closed eyes.\n\n## Eye Bags\n\nAnother clear signal on your dog’s face is the appearance of “eye bags”. These bags are lines under the eyes that are about halfway between the eyes and the mouth.\nThese are veins that fill because the corners of the mouth are pulled slightly backwards. These lines form with fatigue, stress and heat.\n\nWith a puppy you see these lines appear quite quickly when you play with him or when he is in a new environment.\n\n## The Crazy Five Minutes\n\nEveryone knows this one. It is that moment when puppies and adult dogs start running in a frenetic manner. Many puppies also add a lot of biting and often they are not accountable for their behaviour at that time.\n\nThere is usually a fixed period of time on the day in which this happens, and that is usually the end of the afternoon or the beginning of the evening. A whole day has already passed for the puppy: walked several times, did some exercises, played, chewed and maybe made a socialisation trip or had a visit.\n\nAfter such a full day, it may happen that your puppy is extremely tired, but is unable to realise that he should go to sleep.\n\nOr he does not have the peace to go to sleep because he is so busy in his head.\nThe puppy can then go wild and be frenetic running around the garden or from one room to another or chase his own tail. The crazy five minutes or the zoomies.\nAt the end of this crazy five minutes the puppy eventually falls asleep, but often it happens that the puppy in the middle of the game with someone in the house becomes too frenetic and starts biting too hard.\n\nThe puppy is tired, stressed or super excited and as he shows, he is unable to calm himself in that situation. The best solution is, after the zoomies moment passed, is to ensure that your puppy is put in his bench or his bed for a while so that he can find the peace and quiet to sleep.\n\nIn the bench or the bed you can put some safe toys that the pup can bite or chew on to get rid of the tension.\nIf no further attention is paid to the puppy, it usually falls asleep within a couple of minutes.\n\n### What To Do When You See One Of These Signals\n\nIf you see one or more of these signals, then your puppy is ready for a nap!\nIf the puppy does not get any moments of rest or if he cannot take a rest himself, it is important to give him structured rest moments.\n\nThis can be achieved in a bench or in a room where there is little activity and external stimulation so that the puppy will fall asleep. \n\nIf you continue to play when the puppy is already tired, then the game can degenerate and the chances are you end a game in a negative manner, enabling “bad” memories to the puppy.\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2019-11-17T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"A tired puppy is no longer able to record new information.

How did we come to this conclusion? We looked at ingredients (no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives), DMB(P), price, made in a country with high quality and safety standards the food is manufactured (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Western Europe) and reviews.\n\nAs with all reviews, there are people claiming the dog food is bad and harms your dog but this is not always true. As we explained in our article High Protein Dog Food, not every dog is created equally and therefore your dog might get an allergic reaction to the food.\n\nFor this reason, we didn’t weigh the reviews that heavily instead we checked some claims people made about the brand to see if they were true or not. What we found is that people also leave negative reviews when their dog gets an allergic reaction to the food but in our eyes, that’s not the manufacturer’s fault. Your dog is just allergic to a particular ingredient and therefore you should watch your dog’s health.\n\n## 1.

Fish and Meat are both protein-rich sources but they both contain different nutrients.\n\nSome dog food brands also add additional carbohydrates to their dog food. Most dogs will digest these carbohydrates good when cooked but proteins and fats are their natural diet.\n\nSo how do you know which high-protein dog food to choose for your pooch? Well before we get there it’s important to understand what sources are rich in proteins, healthy for your dog and why your dog might (might not) need protein-rich food.\n\n## What Has The Most Protein?\nWe first want to tell you a bit about protein-rich sources. The four grouped sources below are the ones with the highest concentration in proteins. In the next section, we have a few of these protein-rich sources but there are more like greek yogurt, broccoli, lentils, etc.\n\nSome of these protein-rich sources will have better nutrients than others, in the list below we have the best sources for your pooch.\n\n* **Eggs:** Some dog foods contain egg inside but you can always mix a boiled egg under the food and most dogs will love them.\n\n* **Fish:** Some brands sell food that has some source of fish, the most commonly used fish in these foods is salmon because salmon contains a very high omega-3 fatty acid. Omega-3 helps prevent kidney diseases, arthritis, and high cholesterol.\n\n* **Meat:** Is the most natural source of proteins for your furry friend. The most common meats you will find in dog food are beef, turkey, chicken, duck, and venison.\n\n* **Cheese:** It sounds weird but cheese also contains a lot of proteins. When feeding your dog a cheese-based food it’s important to watch the amount of fat. Some cheeses contain more fat than others.\n\nSome brands will add multiple protein sources to their food. These sources should be listed first on the ingredients list. Most of the proteins should come from chicken, salmon, beef or any other kind of meat.\n\nAs you will see in the next section there are differences in the type of meat used in dog food. In general, it shouldn’t be a problem which source is used for proteins unless your dog has an allergic reaction, when this happens it’s important to talk to your vet to figure out which source created the reaction.\n\n## Protein-Rich Sources For Dogs\nWe made a list with some protein-rich sources for your dog. Each protein source has different nutrients as you can see, that is good for your dog’s health. It’s important to keep in mind that not every dog is created equally, therefore your dog might need more or fewer proteins.\n\n### Hard-Boiled Egg (50 grams)\n* **Carbs:** 0.6 grams.\n* **Fat:** 5.3 grams.\n* **Protein:** 6.3 grams.\n\nEgg also contains **Vitamin A, Vitamin B2 (riboflavin), Vitamin B12 (cobalamin), Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), Phosphorus:** 86mg and **Selenium:** 15.4 mcg.\n\n### Almonds (28 grams)\n* **Carbs:** 0 grams.\n* **Fat:** 14 grams.\n* **Protein:** 6 grams.\n\nAlmonds also contain **Vitamin E, Manganese**and **Magnesium.**\n\n### Chicken Breast (172 grams)\n* **Carbs:**0 grams.\n* **Fat:** 6.2 grams.\n* **Protein:** 53.4 grams.\n\n### Cottage Cheese (226 grams)\n* **Carbs:** 6.1 grams.\n* **Fat:** 2.3 grams.\n* **Protein:** 28 grams.\n\nCottage Cheese also contains **Phosphorus, Sodium, Selenium, Vitamin B12, Riboflavin, Calcium,**and **Folate.**\n\n### Skyr (170 grams)\n* **Carbs:** 7 grams.\n* **Fat:** 0 grams.\n* **Protein:** 19 grams.\n\nSkyr also contains **Phosphorus, Calcium, Riboflavin, Vitamin B-12, and Potassium.**\n\n### Broccoli (91 grams)\n* **Carbs:**6 grams.\n* **Fat:**0.4 grams.\n* **Protein:**2.5 grams.\n\n### Beef (100 grams)\n* **Carbs:** 0 grams.\n* **Fat:** 11.8 grams.\n* **Protein:** 26.1 grams.\n\n### Salmon (124 grams)\n* **Carbs:**0 grams.\n* **Fat:**5.5 grams.\n* **Protein:**31.7 grams.\n\nSalmon also contains **Sodium:**107 mg and **Potassium:**513.36 mg.\n\n### Turkey (100 grams)\n* **Carbs:**0 grams.\n* **Fat:** 3.2 grams.\n* **Protein:** 29.9 grams.\n\nTurkey also contains **Omega-3:** 70 mg, **Omega-6:** 570 mg, **Vitamin B3, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B12, Vitamin B1**and **Folate.**\n\nAs you can see some vegetables also contain proteins and are completely safe to feed your dog. Dogs can eat these protein sources, but keep in mind that the dog’s digestive system is built different and might not extract the nutrients they need from it.\n\nTherefore we recommend to go with a meat-based diet, if you, for some reason, decide to feed your pooch vegetarian it’s really important for your dog’s health to check him regularly, muscles, bones, skin, coat, and blood. Your dog might need extra supplements because the vegetarian meal doesn’t digest and provide enough nutrients.\n\nThe information gathered in the table comes from  [healthline.com](https://healthline.com/)  if you have a source in mind to feed your dog you can always check their site for nutrition facts about the source.\n\n## Does My Dog Benefit From A High Protein Food?\nAs with humans, dogs that are active need more proteins for better muscle, tissue and organ development. The normal average healthy dog needs 1.7 grams of proteins per 1 kg of body weight. That means a dog that weighs 27 kg should get 45.9 grams of proteins.\nWhen your dog is more active it burns more calories meaning you should feed your dog extra proteins and fats to keep his body healthy.\n\nWhat’s an active dog you might ask. Mostly active dogs are the ones used in dog sports. We made a list for you to see if your dog belongs to the active dog group or not.\n\n* **Police Dogs**\n\n* **Military K9s**\n\n* **Search and Rescue Dogs**\n\n* **Herding Dogs**\n\n* **Guard Dogs**\n\n* **Tracking Dogs**\n\n* **Hunting Dogs**\n\n* **Agility Dogs**\n\n* **Canicross Dogs**\n\n* **Disc Dogs**\n\n* **Pregnant Dogs**\n\n* **Nursing Dogs**\n\nThe list contains some of the most common sports a dog can do, but when your dog goes running / biking with you, your dog might also need more proteins.\n\nIf you aren’t sure if your dog needs extra proteins it’s always a good idea to ask your veterinarian to test the blood.\n\n## Medical Concerns of High-Protein Dog Food\nMost dogs will handle a high-protein diet perfectly, but some dogs can better avoid a lot of proteins.\n\nThere is a chance your dog might have an allergy for some protein sources, but this doesn’t mean that your dog has to avoid proteins. Dogs with kidney problems better avoid high protein foods. If you’re not sure if your dog has any of these medical conditions you should ask your vet to test the blood.\n\nRecent research shows that healthy older dogs need more proteins than healthy younger dogs because their metabolic-rate is slower than that of younger dogs.\n\nSigns that your dog doesn’t get enough proteins or has an improper protein to calorie ratio may include any or all of the following.\n\n* **Reduced Growth Rate in puppies**\n\n* **Anemia**\n\n* **Weight Loss**\n\n* **Skeletal muscle atrophy**\n\n* **Dull unkempt hair coat**\n\n* **Anorexia**\n\n* **Reproductive problems**\n\n* **Persistent unresponsive parasitism or low-grade microbial infection**\n\n* **Rapid weight loss after injury or during disease**\n\n* **Failure to respond properly to the treatment of injury or disease**\n\nIf any or all of these signs are visible to your dog call a vet and have him/her checked. Don’t try to solve this yourself as you might damage your dog’s health in the process.\n\n## What Makes A Good High-Protein Dog Food?\nThere are no real guidelines that can be used to label high-protein dog food. But the AAFCO published a  [nutrient requirement](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/management-and-nutrition/nutrition-small-animals/nutritional-requirements-and-related-diseases-of-small-animals)  that states:\n\nThe dietary requirement for protein in healthy adult dogs is satisfied when the dog’s metabolic need for amino acids and nitrogen is satisfied. Optimal diets for growing puppies should contain a minimum of 22% protein as dry matter (AAFCO guidelines) or 45 g protein/1,000 kcal ME for puppies 4–14 wk old and 35 g protein/1,000 kcal ME for puppies >14 wk old (NRC guidelines). Adult dogs require a minimum of 18% protein as dry matter (AAFCO guidelines) or ~20 g protein/1,000 kcal of ME required (NRC guidelines).\n\n*The AAFCO*\n\nThis means that dog foods that exceed these levels are high-protein dog foods. But you are not there just yet! Some suggest that high-protein dog food should contain less than 43% carbohydrates and have at least 30% protein.\n\nWhen reading the labels you will also notice a moisture % in your dog food. This gives you the wrong impression of the actual amount of proteins in the food.\n\nIt’s important to find the dry matter basis (DMB) for the dog food.\n\nTo do this you can use the following formula:\n\n**Protein % / (100 % – moisture %) x 100 = Dry Matter Basis (Protein) %**\nAn example would be:\n34% / (100% – 10%) x 100 = 37.7%\n\nYou can use this formula to calculate any DMB% in your dog food, but in this case, we are talking about proteins so we gave the example to calculate the DMB(P).\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Health","categorySlug":"dog-health"},"postDate":"2019-11-16T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Proteins are the most important nutrition for a dog as they build and maintain body tissues, organs, bones, blood, muscles, nails, hair and help build a strong immune system that can prevent diseases."},"postFeaturedImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/6uVFTU2zeglnBYR60qJYV4/e0f1157efc94b3e33b1a9388de499752/High_Protein_Dog_Food.jpg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/6uVFTU2zeglnBYR60qJYV4/e0f1157efc94b3e33b1a9388de499752/High_Protein_Dog_Food.jpg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/6uVFTU2zeglnBYR60qJYV4/e0f1157efc94b3e33b1a9388de499752/High_Protein_Dog_Food.jpg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/6uVFTU2zeglnBYR60qJYV4/e0f1157efc94b3e33b1a9388de499752/High_Protein_Dog_Food.jpg?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/6uVFTU2zeglnBYR60qJYV4/e0f1157efc94b3e33b1a9388de499752/High_Protein_Dog_Food.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=50 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"updatedAt":"2019-11-16T20:20:57.026Z"}},{"node":{"postTitle":"Can Dogs Eat Eggs","postSlug":"can-dogs-eat-eggs","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"Yes, dogs can eat eggs. They contain vitamin A, riboflavin, folate, vitamin B12, iron, selenium, and fatty acids. \n\n## Are eggs good for dogs?\nOf course, eggs are also a good source of linoleic acid and fat-soluble vitamins like Vitamin A. All of these are wonderful for a dog’s skin and coat to make it looks shiny and healthy. \n\n## Are raw eggs bad for dogs?\nThis is a controversial discussion among dog owners. Raw feeders argue for raw eggs, the mixed or non-raw feeders argue for cooked eggs. \n\nFact is eggs can be a source for Salmonella and E.Coli and your puppy can get sick. Some foods lose some of their nutritional value when cooked, but this is not the case with eggs. Better safe than sorry, I say. \n\n## Is eggshell nutritious for dogs?\nEggshells contain calcium and phosphorus, so yes eggshell is good for your dog. The shells can also be valuable for dogs who have difficulty eating bones.\n\n## Is the cholesterol in eggs bad for dogs?\nA positive thing is that you don’t need to worry about cholesterol in your dog, because cholesterol doesn’t have the same effect in dogs as it does in humans and dogs don’t get to the same cholesterol-related diseases as humans do. That means you don’t need to feed egg whites only.\n\n## Can dogs eat an egg a day?\nEggs are not meant to be eaten every day with every meal. A couple of eggs per week are fine, depending on the size of your dog; less for smaller breeds. Make sure you monitor your dog’s stool in order to see if he tolerates eggs in the first place. If any signs of stomach distress appear stop immediately. \n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Health","categorySlug":"dog-health"},"postDate":"2019-11-16T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Eggs are a very important source of nutrients for your puppy.

Too much sugar can cause weight gain, which can lead to other health issues. So don’t go bananas with the bananas. \n\nPeeled bananas are best for dogs, but if your dog eats one whole, don’t worry because banana peels aren’t toxic, but it has a high fiber content which might lead to an upset stomach. \n\nEating too much banana can lead to constipation just as it can happen in humans. The potassium found in bananas is not that well-tolerated in dogs in case ingested in large amounts.\n\nIf your dog eats too many bananas, monitor it closely and if your dog shows any symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, etc. contact your vet asap. \n\n## How to Serve Bananas for Dogs\nAs mentioned earlier, ask your veterinarian before feeding your dog or puppy any new foods. They can tell you the best serving size based on his age, size and more. To serve your dog a banana, peel it and cut it into an appropriate size and share the treat with your pup.\n\nIf your dog doesn’t seem to like fresh bananas, try them frozen. “Freezing a fruit or vegetable is another way of changing its texture to make it interesting. In an animal’s eyes, it probably makes it a different kind of treat, since it’s a different texture and temperature experience,” says Dempsey. Frozen bananas make for an especially tasty and refreshing treat on hot days.\n\n## How many bananas can a dog eat?\nWhen it comes to bananas for dogs and portion size, you shouldn’t give most dogs a whole banana.\n\nA small dog should not eat more than a few small pieces. The same recommendation goes for puppies. Large and medium breeds can eat half a banana a couple of times per week.\n\n## Do It Yourself Banana Recipes for Dogs\nSuper easy and super fast!\n\n### Banana Chips\nCut the bananas in thin slices, place the slices on baking papers and into the oven until crisp. \n\n### Mashed Bananas\nMash up some fresh banana and mix it with your dog’s food or just give it to your dog as a treat. You can even stuff the **Kong Toy** with mashed bananas - either frozen or unfrozen. \n\n### Frozen Slices of Bananas\nSlice up bits of bananas, freeze them and give them to your dogs as a treat.

Apples","postSlug":"can-dogs-eat-apples","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"## Are Apples Safe For Dogs?\n“An apple a day keeps the doctor away!”\n*a well-known truth among us humans, but can dogs eat apples?*\n\nKeep reading to learn how to prepare the apples for your dog, as well as to find out what are the hazards that might occur if you are careless.\n\n## Can I feed my dog apples?\nDogs can eat apples. They are a good fruit to include in your dog’s diet as long as the core and seeds are removed.\n\nBesides being tasty, apples or apple slices are a good source of low protein, high fiber, antioxidants.\n\nConsider different foods that are good for dogs as well, like bananas and carrots to help keep introducing vital vitamins and antioxidants that battle cancer into your dog’s body. \n\n## Are apples good for dogs?\nApples are wonderful alternative crunchy treats for your dog.\n\nSome dogs have a higher food infatuation and apples can be a low-calorie treat for them. \n\nApples with the skin on are full of plant chemicals (phytonutrients) that are thought to be protective against some types of cancer in humans.\n\n## How should you prepare apples for dogs?\nIf you want your dog to enjoy this healthy snack, please make sure to wash off any wax or pesticides the apples might have been treated with.\n\nRemoving the core and deseeding the apples is a must.\n\nDepending on the size of your dog, I recommend cutting the apples up a bit. \n\n## How many apples can dogs have?\nAbout 10% of a dog’s diet should consist of fruits and veggies.\n\nSo it depends on the weight of your dog to determine how much represents 10% actually, but you can always start with a couple of slices.  \n\nNot all dogs like apples from the get-go, so if you still want to provide this healthy snack you might need to put in some convincing work.\n\nMake sure you start with a sweeter apple and not a sour one.\n\nAlso, dogs are best in observing you, so if you eat apples, chances that your dog will also want some are higher. \n\n## Can dogs eat applesauce?\nMost of the applesauce, juices, pie or any products made out of apples contain added sugars.\n\nSo be mindful of this and do not feed your dog extra sugars. \n\nThe answer is: if you cook the natural apples and make the sauce without adding sugars, then sure, feed it to your dog.\n\nOtherwise, I recommend not to do it. \n\n## Can puppies eat apples?\nYes, puppies can eat apples.\n\nPlease supervise puppies when feeding them a new kind of food.\n\nWatch them carefully as they eat a slice or two and then observe if the apple pieces cause any digestive issues.\n\nIf not, apples can make a good treat for your puppy.\n\n## What Are the Benefits of Dog Eating Apples?\nSome senior dogs or dogs must limit the intake of meaty treats due to protein restrictions, or they need to stick to a low-fat diet.\n\nYou can replace their treats, as already stated, with apple chunks.\n\nThe benefits aren’t just for seniors or pups with health issues, though.\n\nFor your younger and active dogs feeding apples can pose as a welcomed benefit. \n\nSome vets believe that the antioxidants and vitamin C of the apples, help with degenerative conditions like joint disease, and the fiber will contribute to overall gastrointestinal health. \n\nAll types of apples contain cyanide in all parts of the plant except the fruit flesh.\nCyanide affects the enzymes responsible for oxygen transport and prevents cells from using the oxygen in the bloodstream making fallen apples a dangerous snack for pets.\n \nSigns of cyanide toxicity include dilated pupils, difficulty breathing, bright red gum color, shock, and death. \n\nHowever, cyanide toxicity is rare in dogs because the whole seeds or pit must be masticated for the cyanide to be released. \n\nDogs and cats will often develop signs of stomach upset, such as vomiting and diarrhea if they ingest parts of an apple. \n\nFruit left on the ground to spoil and ferment can also pose a risk for alcohol toxicity if consumed.\n\n## Do It Yourself Applesauce Recipe for Dogs\nSuper easy and super fast!\n\nWhat you need:\n* Apples (depends on how many apple sauce cubes you’d like to make)\n\n* Water\n\n* Optional banana\n\nHow you do it:\n\n1. Remove core and deseed the apples and cut them into chunks.\n\n2. Put the apples in a blender and start it adding water as needed to bring the mixture to the consistency of apple juice. \n\n3. Add the optional banana if you want to mix things up a bit.\n\n4. Store apple sauce in ice cube trays for a fun, cool treat, or store in freezer bags to thaw and serve at a later date.\n\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canines
