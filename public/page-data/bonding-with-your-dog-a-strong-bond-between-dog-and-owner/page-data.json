Akita that awaited for his human, Professor Ueno, everyday.</p>\n<p>In 1924, the Japanese professor Ueno would each morning say goodbye to his dog Hachiko then walk to the train station and go to work. At three o‚Äôclock, Ueno would return home to find Hachiko sitting by the tracks, waiting for him. Every day for over a year Hachiko would be there, waiting.</p>\n<p>On a day in May of 1925, Hachiko walked as usual down to the station to wait for Ueno‚Äôs return. But, sadly, the professor had died at his school that day and he would never again return to his faithful Hachiko.</p>\n<p>Though given to another family, Hachiko escaped each day and returned to the professor‚Äôs home in hopes of finding him. When this failed, the dog began the old ritual again, arriving each day at the station at precisely three o‚Äôclock, to wait. Hachiko did this every day for the next ten years until his death. </p>\n<p>I bet most of us, dog owners, dream of a bond like that. But how can this be achieved?</p>\n<h2>The Difference Between Relationship And Bond</h2>\n<p>Relationships form fast and are many, they are build easier. Bonds need time to develop and happen only with chosen partners. Before the age of 14 weeks the puppy finds all humans interesting and he is curious about everybody. At this stage in life there is no bonding happening that is why it is ok to allow other humans to take care of him. After the ager of 14 weeks the bonding process can begin. It is recommended to allow your dog to bond with someone else too in case you need to go on a business trip, or you are sick, so that the dog doesn‚Äôt suffer too much when you are away.</p>\n<h2>What Hinders You From Bonding With Your Dog?</h2>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4lh6kS72PabCwjfugqQdJt/a0b3aa3c06a5b7a74bbd3c265431e07b/_MG_0651.jpeg\" alt=\"what hinders you from bonding with your dog\" class=\"post__content--image-full\"/>\n<h3>High Expectations</h3>\n<p>You choose your dog, he has no saying in whether he wants you or not.</p>\n<p>And on top of that some of us have a ‚Äúclear‚Äù image of what this dog should do and don‚Äôt do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be nice to people</li>\n<li>Be nice to other dogs</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt bark</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt howl</li>\n<li>etc, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the dog is given a list of does and don‚Äôts in our head and if he doesn‚Äôt perform accordingly he is punished or yelled at and the worse of all we blame the dog for the failure instead of looking what we did wrong in the communication.</p>\n<p>How is this fair to the dog?</p>\n<h3>Misconception</h3>\n<p>One misconception is mistaking training and education with bonding. These are 3 different things.</p>\n<p>Training is you teaching your dog behaviours and postures and words associated with these. There is no need to be a drill sergeant and yell every command to him. He can hear just fine and being friendly when you ask him to do things will make it more desirable for the dog to work for and with you.</p>\n<p>Education is showing the dog what the rules and boundaries are. Is he allowed on the couch, is he allowed on the bed, who enters the door first, etc.</p>\n<p>Bonding is not training nor education. Bonding is much more than that.</p>\n<h3>Miscommunication</h3>\n<p>Humans mainly communicate verbally while dogs mainly communicate non-verbally, through body language.</p>\n<p>Do you see the gap? If you don‚Äôt learn to body language of your dog and if you only yell 101 commands to him, then you are setting yourself and your dog up for failure.</p>\n<h3>Protection</h3>\n<p>You offer little to no protection and help when your dog is overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>No dog will accept everyone‚Äôs touch and no dog will be friends with all the dogs he meets in his life. Be aware of this fact. Just like you don‚Äôt go for a coffee with everyone you meet or hug everybody you meet.</p>\n<p>Also you don‚Äôt offer your dog the protection he needs is when e.g. during dog play he is bullied and you don‚Äôt react and stop it. Dogs need from their human protection and if you fail to provide it, then he needs to provide it by himself and some dogs will start acting ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù.</p>\n<h3>One Sided Contact</h3>\n<p>The contact is initiated only by your dog being for petting, food, playtime, doesn‚Äôt matter. This will decrease your chance of bonding and you will represent for the dog only a mean to a goal.</p>\n<p>This goes the other way as well. Are you the one always looking for contact with you dog? Make sure you respect when he needs his quiet moments and rest. Read his body language. Is he stretching and asking for more petting or is he turning away trying to tell you he needs his space?</p>\n<h3>Ignoring Eye Contact</h3>\n<p>Ohhh, this is a big one people! Missing out on this one will decrease your chance to bong from a distance with your dog.</p>\n<p>If your dog is looking at you while you are walking him, no matter if on leash or off leash, repay actively that awesome gift he is giving you because even being outside, where everything is exciting, he still is able to overcome those impulses and look at YOU.</p>\n<h2>How To Bond With Your Dog?</h2>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1k29Apqcs2LqTrOuRBNJ44/8e060068dc2927eb8f41a81339ecc065/_MG_4768.jpeg\" alt=\"how to bind with your dog\" class=\"post__content--image-full\"/>\n<h3>Understand The Dog‚Äôs Personality</h3>\n<p>Every dogs is different, just like every human is different. Every dog brings a personality to the relationship and actually this is what makes it awesome.</p>\n<p>Of course your life would be perfect if your dog would walk off leash all the by your side, loved all humans and all dogs. But perfect is boring in my opinion. Life is not perfect and how you respond to the imperfectness of life is what makes you grow and gives you the experience of life.</p>\n<p>My dog was bullied as puppy and I didn‚Äôt see it. I was blind to it and I was uneducated. The bullying caused him to become ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù towards certain dogs and humans that have a certain energy. I know why is happening, I know what triggers him so I am helping him each time he is triggered to overcome the unsafe moment.</p>\n<p>Would I want to change him or give him away? NOT for all the money on the planet.</p>\n<h3>Understand The Dog‚Äôs Communication Language</h3>\n<p>The better you are at understanding your dog‚Äôs language the better your bond and relationship will be. Knowing how to communicate with your dog will improve your chances in correcting unwanted behavior. Remember that first you need to understand why a behavior is used in the first place.</p>\n<h3>Build Trust</h3>\n<p>Your dog should be able to trust you to e.g. not allow people to bend over him and pet him, if he doesn‚Äôt like that. That implies that you get to know your likes and dislikes of your dog.</p>\n<p>By impeding other people or dogs to get near your dog, you show your dog that he can trust you to offer protection. And this goes a very long way in building a bond with your dog.</p>\n<h2>What Activities Help Bonding With Your Dog?</h2>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/6jzs94VVBNYOGiMDGoSQxm/15b0f5a7182884593ac0bdbe51490d75/_MG_7440.png\" alt=\"activities to bound with your dog\" class=\"post__content--image-full\"/>\n<h3>Hiking</h3>\n<p>Spend a day or half a day checking out a new mountain, park, or nature-filled area with your dog and enjoy exploring the outdoors with him.</p>\n<p>Dogs love being outside, and if you want to bond with your dog, you should find as many ways to be outdoors with your dog as possible. Bring some dog-friendly food, and some regular food for you, and have a nice time bonding with your pet while enjoying a nice picnic on the trail.</p>\n<p>Make sure the hiking area allows dogs in advance, and that you have some water and treats on hand for your favorite creature. Also respect leash rules in that areas if there are any.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Advantages:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Going exploring with your dog can help strengthen your bond.</li>\n<li>As you hike together, pay attention to what your dog likes or dislikes. See if he prefers climbing up mountains, playing in wooded areas, or exploring the ground near water. Don‚Äôt make him do something he doesn‚Äôt want to do.</li>\n<li>Keeps you and your dog fit and healthy.</li>\n<li>Hide and Sniff</li>\n<li>You can show your dog his favorite toy, and then hide it in an easy-to-find location. He‚Äôll love playing this game and will be rewarded with the toy once he finds it. You can tell him what a good boy he is for playing the game and for being so smart. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Play Outside</h3>\n<p>Use being outdoors to keep yourself and your dog fit. Play fetch or Frisbee. Make sure that before you start the high intensity play, your dog and you had a chance to warm up a bit.</p>\n<h3>Toy Picking</h3>\n<p>Sometimes I offer my dog the right to choose what toy he takes out on out hike/walk. I hold two of his favourite toys in my hands and allow him to grab which ever he likes.</p>\n<h3>Pet With Purpose</h3>\n<p>Instead of watching TV and petting your dog, try to give your attention to him while petting as well. Or maybe instead of petting you give him a well deserved massage.</p>\n<p>Though it may sound silly, just spending a couple of minutes once a week giving your dog a nice, relaxing massage can help deepen your bond. Massage him as you would a human ‚Äî behind the ears, on the neck, on his back, and anywhere that seems to make him feel good. Start off gently and deepen your massages if your dog seems to like it. This will be a great way for you to physically connect with your dog.</p>\n<p>Every dog is different. Some like to be massaged, while some may wrangle out of your grasp. Get a feel for what your dog likes as you try this new bonding activity. If he just prefers to be petted, then don‚Äôt force it and stick to that.</p>\n<h2>Conculsion</h2>\n<p>My view of the dog-human bonding is that it is founded on love, trust, and understanding and not a relationship where one partner is submissive to the other.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!
