800px"}}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The goal of this blog is to give you a checklist of what you need and what you should consider when you are getting a dog for the first time. </p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2qXUmWl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Food and Water Bowls</a></h2>\n<p>When shopping for a dog bowl, some considerations including cost, style, safety, purpose, durability, and ease of cleaning need to be taken into consideration. </p>\n<p>You can get plastic bowls, ceramic bowls, stainless steel bowls, automatic feeding bowls üôÉ, elevated bowls, and so on. </p>\n<p>I personally prefer the ceramic bowls because they keep the water cool a bit longer and in my experience they do better in the dishwasher. I am no fan or promoter for automatic feeders for the simple fact that your dog seeing you as his food provider contributes to the bond between you and your dog. </p>\n<p>Another thing that you should consider is the size of the bowls. It goes hand in hand with the size of your dog, at least for the food bowl. I have a 40kg male shepherd dog and he has a medium sized food bowl and a 2.5L water bowl. I change his water 2-3 times a day, to ensure he always has fresh water available. </p>\n<h2>Food and Treats</h2>\n<p>Food is a huuuuge subject in dog nutrition. What you feed determines the health and lifespan of your dog. So choose carefully. </p>\n<p>Choosing the right food requires long research and ultimately is a balance between what your dog likes, healthy affordable food and how much time you are willing to invest in preparing the food. </p>\n<p>Raw feeding requires you to plan ahead either weekly or monthly and takes up some time. After the prep is done, then it is relatively easy to feed to your dog. </p>\n<p>Feeding dry food or canned food is much easier than raw, but the quality varies strongly (most of them contain more grains and corn than anything else) and there are only a handful high quality dry and/or canned food providers out there. </p>\n<p>Reading the ingredients on some of the dry food bags I couldn‚Äôt stop but wonder sometimes if they have mistakenly put in chicken food rather than dog food. üôà</p>\n<p>Treats are awesome for training or for the times your dog does something awesome just by himself.  Use dried fish, fish skin, chicken, bananas, apples, cheese, etc. The list is long, but keep in mind that your dog has a saying int his as well. </p>\n<h2>Collars, Leashed and Harnesses</h2>\n<p>Flat and wide collar paired with a good, sturdy 2m leash and a good harness that crosses the sternum of your dog is all you need in the beginning. </p>\n<p>Try not to start suffering from GAS ( ~G~ ear ~A~ cquisition ~S~ yndrome)  :-).   </p>\n<h2>Dog Tag</h2>\n<p>There are thousands of websites out in the www that will make a dog tag for a couple of $. Make sure you include your name, name of the dog and your phone number on it. This little piece of gear can be very helpful if a dog gets lost or runs away. </p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://amzn.to/32Ym7eO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Beds and Crates</a></h2>\n<p>Dogs need their own place where they can relax and feel secure, like a¬†dog bed or crate. A dog bed gives your pet somewhere comfortable to sleep at night or rest during the day, while a crate provides a more secure setting for a dog, much like a den.  </p>\n<p>You can also use a crate as a safe place to have your dog stay when you‚Äôre not at home for a few hours or so. For tips on how to crate train your dog¬†read our Crate Training Blog.</p>\n<h2>Puppy Sanitary Pads</h2>\n<p>Puppy pads are a great asset to have in your home if you have a young puppy in the house. Puppies need to go more often than mature dogs and if you are not fast enough accidents will happen on you carpet, wooden floor, sofa, etc. </p>\n<p>Teaching your puppy to use the sanitary pad will help you keep your house cleaner and allows your puppy to relieve himself in case he needs to go really bad. :-)</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://amzn.to/37fNOTw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Toys</a></h2>\n<p>Dogs love to play with toys, but some of those toys can be hazardous for vigorous dogs. For example, dogs can tear open toys that have a squeaker or other small item inside, which can be a choking hazard. </p>\n<p>Choose tough toys¬†for your dog instead, so you‚Äôll have more peace of mind during playtime. Tough toys are much more durable and provide your dog with hours of enjoyment without falling apart. They also give dogs a great way to ease the anxiety of frustration by chewing.</p>\n<h2>Poop Scooper and Poop Bag</h2>\n<p>Cleaning up poop is an inevitable part of dog ownership. Whether in your own yard or on a walk, you know that if you own a dog, you‚Äôll be stooping the poop at regular intervals. </p>\n<p>You can use a poop scooper if you are not feeling kin sticking your hand into a bag and grab the poop. </p>\n<p>Lately biodegradable poop bags came on the market, if you are looking for an environmentally friendly option. </p>\n<h2>Grooming Products (Brushes, Shampoos, Nail Clippers)</h2>\n<p>Your dog will need to be groomed regularly with brushing and bathing. Pick up grooming supplies, such as brushes, dog shampoo and nail clippers so you‚Äôll have these items handy. </p>\n<p>Choose a brush that‚Äôs suitable for your dog‚Äôs coat, depending on the length and texture. I personally own 2 different brushes: one for the undercoat and one for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù brushing. Of course you can leave out the undercoat brush if your dog has no undercoat. </p>\n<p>There are many brands and variations of dog shampoos, but I decided to use baby shampoo for my dog. It is milder, cheaper and since it is made for human babies, it contains less chemicals. </p>\n<p>Clipping nails are really handy for shortening your dog‚Äôs nails. If you are not comfortable doing this, you can always ask your vet. </p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://amzn.to/37gcrj7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Car Cover</a></h2>\n<p>Car seat covers help protect your car‚Äôs interior from mud and dirt while also cutting down on the amount of dog hair inside your vehicle. </p>\n<p>You can place these covers over your car seats anytime you plan on bringing your dog for a ride. They provide your dog with a more comfortable place to lie down and reduce the risk of stains.¬†</p>\n<h2>Seat Belt Restraint</h2>\n<p>Whether you plan on taking your dog on a trip or just for the occasional ride to the vet or other places, you need to have a seat belt restraint in your vehicle. </p>\n<p>These items are designed to keep dogs from sliding around inside vehicles, which helps keep them safer. Some dogs have a hard time staying in one place as vehicles stop, turn or make other movements, and a seat belt restraint helps give them a sense of stability. </p>\n<p>Seat belt restraints can also keep your dog safe if you‚Äôre in an accident and in Europe they are even mandatory.</p>\n<h2>First Aid Kits</h2>\n<p>I have two different first aid kits: one for at home and one for on the road when we go on our hike adventures. </p>\n<p>My home kit includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Non-Stick Bandages</li>\n<li>Gauze Bandage Rolls</li>\n<li>Adhesive Tape</li>\n<li>Hydrogen Peroxide 3%</li>\n<li>Digital Thermometer</li>\n<li>Scissors</li>\n<li>Tweezers</li>\n<li>Syringes</li>\n<li>Towel</li>\n<li>Soft Muzzle</li>\n<li>Tick tweezer</li>\n<li>Activated Charcoal</li>\n<li>Traumeel Homeopathic Anti-Inflammatory Pain Relief Analgesic</li>\n<li>Bepanthen First Aid Antiseptic Wound Healing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My hike kit includes all of the above but in smaller doses (no thermometer) and additionally I pack:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whistle</li>\n<li>Harness (in case I need to lift my dog)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dog Physiology Basic Knowledge</h2>\n<p>It always makes sense to attend every two years a first aid course for humans as well as for dogs. Basic knowledge about the dog‚Äôs physiology will make a difference in case of emergencies. </p>\n<p>You should be able to provide CPR and tent to wounds until you reach a vet.\nCheck in your area if the offer first aid courses or try online course or books.</p>\n<p>Some online tips from my side:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://teamdog.pet/join-trikos-team-dog/\" title=\"Mike Ritland - Team Dog\">Mike Ritland - Team Dog</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Kx2d4i\" title=\"A Complete Guide to Protecting Your Pooch, Indoors and Out \">The Safe Dog Handbook: A Complete Guide to Protecting Your Pooch, Indoors and Out</a></strong> by Melanie Monteiro</p>\n<h2>Vet</h2>\n<p>It is always a good idea to select a vet before you actually <em>need</em> one. This way, you‚Äôll be working with someone who you feel comfortable with and seems to have a good rapport with your pet rather than a vet who is simply nearby, open, or listed first in the Yellow Pages.</p>\n<p>Best way to search and select a vet is by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>asking other dog owners</li>\n<li>searching on the internet for vets around you (it makes no sense to have a vet that is 1h drive away in case of an emergency)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Have a card of the 24h coverage vet clinics around you on your phone or fridge or wherever your point of info is in the house.\nIf you travel look up a vet clinic upfront so that you have the address in case you need to get to one fast. </p>\n<h2>Health Insurance &#x26; Damage Insurance</h2>\n<p>Pet insurance policies offer varying degrees of coverage. Some of the most common options available include basic coverage for common illnesses and accidental injury, wellness plans for routine immunisations and preventative care, veterinarian plans for regular check-ups and surgical discounts and additional liability plans should your pet bite or harm another person.</p>\n<p>Some pet insurance offers plans for dogs and cats that cover illnesses and accidents, hereditary and congenital conditions, cancer care, chronic conditions, emergency and specialty care, x-rays, blood tests, ultrasounds, surgery, hospitalisation, prescriptions and alternative care. </p>\n<p>You can spend lots of money with insurance policies, so choose carefully, calculate what you afford and make a judgement also based on your dog‚Äôs health condition. Some dogs are more prone to get sick than others. </p>\n<p>During my dog‚Äôs first year I opted for a basic insurance which only covers accidental injuries, including surgery, scans, hospitalisation, etc whatever is needed as a result to the accident. Additionally to this I go once a year with my dog to the vet to have an overall checkup, including blood work, and get his vaccines done since we travel around a lot. </p>\n<p>Apart from health insurance it is advisable, if not mandatory (it is where I live) to have a insurance in case your dog will cause damages (biting someone, breaking something, etc).</p>\n<h2>Register Your Dog</h2>\n<p>Get your dog chipped and registered with the city. It is important to have your credentials stored and linked with your dog‚Äôs chip number inc are he gets lost. </p>\n<h2>Dog School</h2>\n<p>From teaching your dog   basic obedience or advanced training  for dog sports, a great dog trainer can make all the difference. This is particularly important for new dog owners. But even if you have years of experience with canine companions, a professional trainer can help you troubleshoot problems and hone your abilities. Plus, group classes have the wonderful benefit of socialising your pup. </p>\n<p>Try to ask some open-ended questions so that trainers can explain their philosophy to you in depth. Here some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What method of training do you use?</li>\n<li>What is your educational background in the area of dog training (and behaviour if applicable)?</li>\n<li>What equipment do you use?</li>\n<li>What kind of follow-up do you provide with your clients?</li>\n<li>Can you provide a list of clients we can contact for references?</li>\n<li>What sort of services do you provide for dog owners? </li>\n<li>Do you provide specialised services? (i.e. therapy dog training, competitive dog sports training, service dog training)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I read once ‚ÄúPick a dog trainer as if you‚Äôre choosing a neurosurgeon‚Äù.
