This is legal obligation you as dog owner need to meet. Some countries even ask you to put a muzzle on your dog. So if you travel, make sure to read the legal obligations you need to meet.</p>\n<h2>Why does my dog always pull on the leash?</h2>\n<p>Most will say it is because the dog is excited, happy to be outside and wants to get faster to a certain place. While this is partly true, it is also true that the one that is in front leads the way.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the topic of leading your dog on the leash is closely linked to other areas of life: if you do not control your dog on a leash, it will certainly not be controlled in other areas of life.</p>\n<p>But it is also important that your dog can feel your leadership skills in such important situations as leading him on the leash. If you can not enforce your interests on the leash and let yourself be drawn to each blade of grass, then you probably will not be able to do it in other areas of the dog‚Äôs life either. You lose competence in your dog‚Äôs eyes. The dog will not follow an incompetent boss, especially not when it comes to secure and defend vital resources: protection, living area, etc.</p>\n<h2>How do you train a dog to walk on a leash without pulling?</h2>\n<p>The goal of leading on a leash is that your dog walks behind you on a loose leash - in every situation.</p>\n<p>Your dog should learn that he must pay attention to you and not you to him. At the moment you may be paying attention to him by constantly asking him to come with you, waiting when he wants to put for the 10h time yet another drop of pee on the grass, or just give in to his sniffing and let him follow each small he finds interesting.</p>\n<p>Does this description seem familiar: dog way in front of you, pulling you wherever he wants to go and you stumbling almost behind him with stretched arm?</p>\n<h2>How to stop a dog from pulling on the leash?</h2>\n<p>First of all make peace with the fact that dog training is all about patience, calmness and consistent training.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Training Yourself To Walk Your Dog on a Leash</h2>\n<p>Pay attention to your body language. It should be purposeful and radiate leadership skills: so chest out, shoulder straightened, straight back. Clear your mind of previous bad experiences, breath, YOU can do this!</p>\n<p>Set a fixed goal and walk determined towards that goal. Be consistent. Once you leash your dog, you need to demonstrate your leadership skills.</p>\n<p>Keep yourself calm and assertive while walking your dog. The moment you lose your cool the tension will travel down the leash and it will change the state of mind of your dog.</p>\n<p>My dog was a dog reactive dog and it took me months of hard work (calmness, consistency, body language checks, repetitions) to get to where I am today: walking by dogs without having my dog react, bark, jump, pull etc.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Training Your Dog to Walk on a Leash</h2>\n<h3>Introduce</h3>\n<p>Introduce your dog to the collar and leash. You can let your puppy wear the collar in the house and you can start leash training in the house first. Choose the correct leash and collar for your dog. Make sure you also feel comfortable with holding the leash and it feels good in your hand.</p>\n<p>It is a leash leading etiquette to lead your dog on your left side. Get used to that and get your dog used to that. Because some dog owners do not train their dogs (a total shame in my opinion - it is like buying a 500 horsepower car and drive every day 30 mph), I thought my dog to heel on both sides, just in case I need to switch sides. I have different commands for the different sides and it is a pleasure to be able to adapt to different situations.</p>\n<h3>Teach a Command Word</h3>\n<p>Put the leash on and just make the puppy follow you. You want to teach that cue that you will use later on when you want the dog to be at your side and follow your lead. I use ‚Äúheel‚Äù, but you can use anything that makes sense to you.</p>\n<p>You will start with cue and gesture in the beginning. The gesture is to help your dog understand the cue. Over the course of time the gesture will become less and less and only the verbal cue will remain. This obviously doesn‚Äôt apply to deaf dogs.</p>\n<h3>Mark &#x26; Reward</h3>\n<p>When your dog is doing what you want, and please understand that NO dog will make a perfect heel the first time training, then you <strong>mark</strong> the moment and <strong>reward</strong> your dog. It is enough if the dog starts walking only one step next to you. After that you build it up to 2, 3, 5, 10 etc steps before you mark and reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Marker</strong> can be either a clicker or a word. The word must always be the same word, with same length and intonation. This is why some people prefer the clicker.</li>\n<li></li>\n<li><strong>The Reward</strong> is either good ham, chicken, bacon or a toy that is only used for training purposes like a ball, bite tug toy. The reward follows the marker.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 3: Leash-Training Troubleshooting</h2>\n<h3>Pulling</h3>\n<p>Remember why a dog is pulling and walking up front! Yes, desire to get somewhere but it is also because you do not step up as a leader. Check your body language, give the command word and walk like you own the road.</p>\n<p>If your dog starts pulling in a direction, stop and wait for the dog to turn towards you and set him again in the start position - heeling. Give the command again and start walking. Don‚Äôt walk only straight ahead. Dogs are not stupid and they kind of know the route and the routine after 5 days. Take another route, the other side of the road.</p>\n<p>Change between side of the roads frequently, when the dog least expects it. Turn and go back 10 steps. Turn left, turn right and so on. Adapt it to where you live and don‚Äôt do all the time the same thing.</p>\n<p>When I took my ‚ÄúCanine Good Citizen‚Äù Exam (the FCI Version of it), I had to do a certain walking scheme with my dog: walk 12 steps, stop, tell my dog to sit, walk away, turn, go back to my dog and continue with the exercise. After 2-3 weeks of trading I notice that my dog started sitting after the 12 steps before I even got to say sit. Why? Because this little mischievous bundle of sweetness learned ‚Äúoh heck same thing all the time: after 12 steps I need to sit‚Ä¶ here we go, I sit! Boooring‚Äù.</p>\n<h2>I became boring to my dog!</h2>\n<p>So I started then switching things up: sit after 5 steps, after 15, after 10, after 20.</p>\n<h3>Lunging</h3>\n<p>If your dog is going after something while on a walk ‚Äî another dog, a car, or skateboarder, for example, try to redirect his attention to you before he has a chance to lunge and create space between you and the target. Be proactive. Get prepared before the target of his frustration or excitement gets too close.</p>\n<p>This type of behavior is more common in <strong>herding breeds</strong>, who like to chase.</p>\n<h3>Barking</h3>\n<p>Some dogs have the habit of barking at other dogs while on a walk. Oftentimes, this behavior comes as a result of lack of exercise. Make sure your dog gets the proper amount of mental and physical stimulation for his breed. If this is still a problem, use the same process as you would if your dog is lunging.</p>\n<p>Make sure that you pay attention at your dog‚Äôs body language. Dogs will tell you long before they react that they will do that. They can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúHey human! See that jogger coming? His shoes bother the heck out of me so I will go for them when he is in reach!‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Dogs make a very <strong>light change in their demeanour</strong> to tell what it is going on in their head and if you miss it, then you need to handle the lunging, jumping, barking, etc.</p>\n<p>Time, patience and repetition will make YOU better at reading your dog as well it will give your dog the change to learn what is expected of him.</p>\n<h3>Leash Etiquette</h3>\n<p>Leash laws may require your puppy to walk nicely on a leash and know how to heel when off your property. But, even if they don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs simply polite puppy behavior to know leash etiquette. With proper leash manners, your dog has more freedom to safely explore the world beyond your front or backyard.</p>\n<p>To those people that are super proud of their off-leashed dogs and are stunned by others that do leash their dogs and shout out ‚Äù my dog just wants to play‚Äù or ‚Äù my dog is harmless‚Äù: good for you!</p>\n<p>Not all dogs are the same and if the other person is leashing their dog than be respectful and responsible and do the same. Not the dog owner with the leashed dog has a misbehaved dog, but the one that doesn‚Äôt leash the dog.</p>\n<p>Just because your dog is playful and harmless doesn‚Äôt mean that the other dog is and wants to do the same things. You don‚Äôt go for coffee with everybody either.</p>\n<p>Just because your dog is playful and harmless doesn‚Äôt mean that it is true. More often owners don‚Äôt know what their dog is doing and what signals the dog is giving to the other dog. </p>\n<p>A dog that does not want to play with others and even reacts dismissively and aggressively does not have a behavior problem, but it is rather a natural dog that just likes to be left alone. You don‚Äôt allow everybody on the street to hug you either. </p>\n<p><strong>Refer to my training guide for detailed descriptions.</strong></p>\n<p>Puppies do not instinctively know how to walk on a leash. When you pull, dogs instinctively pull back, and if you allow the pup to win, that can make it even more difficult for them to overcome the urge to do it.</p>\n<p>It is much easier to teach a small puppy than a powerful adolescent or adult. If you have a puppy, then now is the perfect time to teach it to walk nicely on a leash. Begin immediately when you bring the pup home. If you have an adolescent or adult dog, here is even more important to walk like a boss and show your dog you can provide guidance, leadership, protection, food, and fun.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!
