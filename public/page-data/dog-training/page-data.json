That is why it is <strong>your responsibility</strong> to educate him through <strong>training</strong> and <strong>socialization</strong>. </p>\n<p>Teaching your dog <strong>basic dog obedience training</strong> gives you and your pet some essential <strong>benefits</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it brings more <strong>structure and deeper bond</strong> in your relationship with your dog</li>\n<li>it will tell your dog that you can be in charge and you can <strong>lead</strong></li>\n<li>it will give you <strong>better control</strong> of your dog</li>\n<li>it can <strong>save his life</strong> in dangerous situations</li>\n<li>it provides much-needed <strong>brain stimulation</strong> for your dog</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/complete-guide-on-dog-training\">Complete Guide To Dog Training</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, your dog has to be able to ‚Äú<a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-sit\">sit</a>‚Äù. </li>\n<li>Take a treat and show it to your dog. </li>\n<li>Then run the treat on the floor in front of the dog‚Äôs eyes. He will then lie down automatically. </li>\n<li>Then say ‚Äúdown‚Äù together with the hand signal, <a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/how-to-clicker-train-your-dog-the-best-way-in-7-steps\">click</a>, praise and give the treat to your dog on the floor. </li>\n<li>Try training the ‚Äúdown‚Äù command in distracting locations and increase the time your dog has to lie still on the floor for advanced dogs. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is an <strong>upgrade</strong> for those puppies that already master a strong down command from close up. </p>\n<h2>In what situations is a down command at a distance helpful?</h2>\n<p>A reliable down at a distance is worth its weight in gold if you want to put your dog down quickly and spontaneously by the side of the road, for example when a cyclist or jogger is insight. The cyclist or jogger can pass your dog unhindered. Then you release your dog with your release signal, and he can resume the walk and sniff-sniff right away.</p>\n<p>A down at a distance is also helpful if you want to check your dog's attention. If your dog seems to be lost in his own world, call out the command \"Down\" loud and clear and test whether your dog can break through the strong external focus and is still online. If your dog has blocked you out, go to him in a relaxed manner, put him on a leash and continue your walk on a leash until your dog is with you again with his thoughts.</p>\n<p><strong>I also use the \"down\" at a distance as an employment opportunity.</strong> While we walk together through nature, I spontaneously give Thor the command to lie down. He lies down while I continue walking on my way. </p>\n<p>For this exercise, buy a pocket mirror so that you can see if and when your dog gets up. If he does, bring your dog back to the starting point and repeat the exercise. After a certain distance, I turn around and call Thor to come to me. This is a game of concentration and allows your puppy to do some sprints :-). It is a well balanced and fun game for Thor.</p>\n<p>You can use the down command to improve the impulse control of a dog which proves to me to be very helpful in many situations. </p>\n<p>What I do is tell Thor to lie down, and I throw a toy while your dog has to wait. Then send your dog towards the toy and stop him halfway with the command down at a distance. </p>\n<p>I rarely used a leash with Thor while training, but thinking back probable it would have spared us some arguing moments :-). </p>\n<p>To start with, a towing line attached to a harness is advantageous so that your dog cannot unintentionally run-up to the toy and ignore your command. This exercise is challenging for your dog and therefore requires a lot of time and repetition.</p>\n<h2>Impulse Control In Dogs</h2>\n<p>Until now, your dog only had to carry out the command \"down\" close to you. So he memorised the command \"down\" as being an action performed next to you.  Therefore it is totally logical to want to run to you first when the command \"down\" sounds. </p>\n<p>Before you start training from a distance, your dog should be able to reliably execute the \"normal\" command \"down\" in all possible situations, even with medium to strong distraction. Only then do you start training in small steps at a distance.</p>\n<p>Practice in very small training units. Two to three times per walk are sufficient. </p>\n<p>You first start with the down in motion when your dog is in the immediate vicinity, and he walks comfortably next to you. Pronounce the \"down\" command loud and clear and support it with physical language if necessary. </p>\n<p>Outside I want a quick - no ifs and buts - down. Therefore I put a light body language pressure into the exercise (I make a push down sign with my opened palm) which I immediately take out again as soon as the dog lies down. This is very important so that the dog does not feel unnecessarily pressured. Release the down quickly with your release signal. Repeat the exercise until it works well in at least 8 out of 10 cases.</p>\n<p>Increase the difficulty by walking one or two steps further after your dog lies down. Your dog must remain in the down position. If he stands up on his own, you use <a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/how-to-correct-unwanted-dog-behaviour\" title=\"correction signal\">your correction signal</a> and bring him back to the starting position in a very relaxed manner and walk a few more steps. This time, give your release signal a little earlier so that your dog does not get up on his own again.</p>\n<p>You can dissolve the place at a distance in two different ways:\nEither you call your dog to you from a distance with your callback command or\nyou give your release signal from a distance, and your dog is allowed to freely roam around.</p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting: Your dog always runs up to you?</h2>\n<p>Train at a much shorter distance. Always start with very small steps and slowly work your way up. </p>\n<p>You can support your dog by stopping him with your body language when he starts walking towards you. To do this, turn towards your dog frontally with your arm stretched out forward and a \"stop sign hand\" until he stops and pauses. Then give your command again from a distance.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is to attach a towing line to your dog's harness and place it around a tree. You hold the end of the towing line in your hand. Initially stand only half a meter away from your dog and give the \"down\" command. With the towing line taut, your dog can only run as far in your direction as you want him to. If your dog lies down, you praise him and drop the hand loop. Now you release your dog via one of the above mentioned two ways.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"üçÇHiker Girl \nüê∂Thor, the GSD and Belgian Malinois mix, is my soul dog\nüì∑Humble Photographer\nü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yogi\nüå†Stardust\n‚òï üç´ü•ëLover\n\n"},"authorImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=566&h=566&q=50 566w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"authorSlug":"alexandra","authorName":"Alexandra"},"createdAt":"2020-03-25T13:00:11.561Z"}},{"node":{"updatedAt":"2020-07-16T13:42:19.740Z","postTitle":" How To Correct Unwanted Dog Behaviour","postSlug":"how-to-correct-unwanted-dog-behaviour","postFeaturedImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4988290398126465,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/13ajhO86KlLLze3rFbDBce/166add4d7e1398b413134cb367b89641/Project_Thor_15_Large.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/13ajhO86KlLLze3rFbDBce/166add4d7e1398b413134cb367b89641/Project_Thor_15_Large.jpeg?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/13ajhO86KlLLze3rFbDBce/166add4d7e1398b413134cb367b89641/Project_Thor_15_Large.jpeg?w=400&h=267&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/13ajhO86KlLLze3rFbDBce/166add4d7e1398b413134cb367b89641/Project_Thor_15_Large.jpeg?w=800&h=534&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/13ajhO86KlLLze3rFbDBce/166add4d7e1398b413134cb367b89641/Project_Thor_15_Large.jpeg?w=1200&h=801&q=50 1200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/13ajhO86KlLLze3rFbDBce/166add4d7e1398b413134cb367b89641/Project_Thor_15_Large.jpeg?w=1280&h=854&q=50 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"postDescription":{"postDescription":"Whenever your dog shows unwanted behaviour, you want to correct your dog, but you are not sure how to do it to be effective and cruelty-free?

"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In this blog, you will find essential tips on how to correct your dog when he shows unwanted behaviour. </p>\n<p>I will tell you what different types of corrections there are and when corrections make sense to use.</p>\n<h2>Why Corrections Fail</h2>\n<p>When the word \"correction\" is used, many people believe that the dog will be punished. This is definitely not the case. What you want to achieve is to show your dog that certain behaviours are not ok. </p>\n<p>However, it should always be in the foreground that you do not have to correct the dog at all or only very rarely. You can ensure this by paying attention to a good education of your dog from the beginning.</p>\n<p><strong>Unwanted behaviour is usually caused by the unfavourable combination of lack of human guidance and demanding, impulsive behaviour of your dog.</strong>  </p>\n<p>Rough commands or harsh leash jerks may bring improvement for a few seconds, but they are never a long-term success. </p>\n<p><strong>The key to your success</strong> is to become a secure, balanced and assertive social partner for your dog. A partner that knows what he wants and enforces their wish in a friendly and fair manner. </p>\n<h2>Understand Your Dog</h2>\n<p>Most troubles start because <strong>you, as the dog owner, do not speak dog language</strong>. What the dog actually communicates through its behaviour and body language is usually hidden from the dog owner due to a lack of dog language skills. </p>\n<p>__Many dog owners misjudge the behaviour of their dog and then unfavourably believe what they think. __</p>\n<p>This is already one of the biggest reasons why undesirable behaviour occurs in the first place. Correcting the dog without dog language skills will not work, and the dog's behaviour will often even be made worse by the owner.</p>\n<p>__Due to the miscommunication between your dog and yourself, not only the unwanted behaviour remains, but also the trust relationship between you and your dog suffers. __</p>\n<p>For a harmonious relationship, it is essential to learn to speak your dog's language. </p>\n<p>Besides, it is essential to limit undesirable behaviour through management. For example, if your dog enjoys jumping on other people, practice correcting exactly this behaviour with friends you asked to help you with this exercise. </p>\n<h2>How To Correct Your Dog - The Verbal Correction</h2>\n<p>A verbal correction is a spoken word. The word \"no\" is very popular because it has the meaning of \"leave it alone\" for us humans. </p>\n<p>For the dog, however, the \"No\" is merely a mostly frustrated or annoyed sounding noise without a clear meaning. </p>\n<p>The \"No\" is used very often in everyday life and can be changed in an emotionally unfavourable direction. </p>\n<p>The \"No\" quickly becomes a \"Nah-Nah... NO!!! ...just stop it already!\" This confuses the dog and can have a counterproductive effect on the training.</p>\n<p>It is better to use a catchy, unambiguous correction word that you would otherwise not use in everyday life to correct the dog.</p>\n<h2>How To Correct Your Dog - The Acoustic Correction</h2>\n<p>An acoustic correction is a sound that can make the dog responsive again. </p>\n<p>It can be a hissing, a clapping of the hands or even a rattling with the bunch of keys. </p>\n<p>Let's assume your dog is staring at another dog. To interrupt this, you address your dog in a friendly manner with his name or the attention signal. </p>\n<p>However, your dog does not react and continues to stare at the dog. Now you should correct your dog by using an acoustic noise which surprises your dog and interrupts its focus on the other dog. </p>\n<p>You use the second he diverts his attention from the other dog to keep your dog's focus on you. Interact with your dog in a friendly manner and make yourself more interesting than the other dog. </p>\n<p>If your dog is very anxious, you should refrain from this type of correction, as it could disturb the dog even more. </p>\n<p>Likewise, avoid using acoustic corrections to exert a PERMANENT influence on your dog, as they will otherwise lose their effect.</p>\n<h2>How To Correct Your Dog - The Tactile Correction</h2>\n<p>Tactile corrections are touches. Everybody knows the situation: You sit entirely lost in your thoughts in front of the television or computer. Suddenly someone taps you on the shoulder. You are immediately wide awake by the surprising touch. </p>\n<p>This form of correction can also work for dogs. The touch should be made quickly and with tense, outstretched fingers in the shoulder - or neck area or even on the flank.</p>\n<h3>Be aware!</h3>\n<p>Some dogs see the touch as the beginning of a funny game. In this case, please refrain from touching as a correction. </p>\n<p>Some dogs may snap or redirect their aggressivity towards your hand. Be aware of the state of mind of your dog, learn his language and do no use this type of correction in these situations. </p>\n<h2>How To Correct Your Dog - The Body Language Correction</h2>\n<p>You use the body language correction of the dog as a consequence of your dog disregarding your verbal or acoustic correction or your attention signal.</p>\n<p>An upright, tense body is essential for body language correction. Your movements are controlled, and you never become hectic at any time. One way is to block your dog's forward movement with an upright upper body and one leg stretched out to the side. </p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can turn frontally in the direction of your dog and take one or two more steps towards him. Your body language message has reached the dog when he stops and is no longer in forwarding motion.</p>\n<h3>Pay attention to the necessary sensitivity!</h3>\n<p>Body language that is too strong can frighten your dog, and body language that is too weak will simply cause your dog to continue to ignore you.</p>\n<h2>How To Correct Your Dog - The Auxiliary Correction</h2>\n<p>Corrections with aids, such as a leash, harness, collar or a halter should - like all corrections - also be carried out with caution. Especially the use of a collar should be explained to you by a specialist, as improper use can lead to severe injuries to the cervical spine.</p>\n<p>Some dog owners reach for the water bottle to correct the dog and interrupt its behaviour. It is essential to refrain from this correction without consulting a competent dog trainer.</p>\n<h2>How To Correct Unwanted Dog Behaviour?</h2>\n<p>Corrections that you have to repeat every meter will not change the undesirable behaviour of your dog, but will only dull him. </p>\n<p>There are reasons if the measures to correct the dog have been unsuccessful so far. </p>\n<p>One reason could be that you have not yet sufficiently practised the desired behaviour. Another reason could be that the distracting stimuli are simply still too strong for your dog, and he has difficulty concentrating.</p>\n<p>Reflect on your behaviour in conflict situations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure that the difficulty of the situation is adapted to your dog's abilities</li>\n<li>Make sure you do not have a frustrated or annoyed underlying mood</li>\n<li>Make sure that your timing is right and that you use the type and intensity of correction appropriate to your type of dog.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Announce the correction</h3>\n<p>Do not correct your dog without warning. Always give him the chance to react to your friendly speech first. </p>\n<p>I try to address Thor with his name first and expect him to turn around and give me his attention. </p>\n<p>However, if he is past his threshold where he can disengage from whatever hypnotized him, I then use one of the previously mentioned corrections. </p>\n<p>Even a change of direction can have a corrective effect on unwanted behaviour. I always make decisions based on the situation and use the correction that seems most helpful to me in the situation. That doesn‚ÄôT mean I don‚Äôt screw up from time to time. It is a learning curve for your and for your dog. </p>\n<h3>Stay In The Moment</h3>\n<p>Now comes the most crucial point! A successful correction is characterized by the fact that the intensity of your dog‚Äôs unwanted behaviour immediately decreases noticeably, and he is responsive again. </p>\n<p>__Only then a correction makes sense! __</p>\n<p>Do not leave your dog standing in the rain after the correction. Show him that this is precisely what you want him to do. Praise him in a calm voice, relax your body, position yourself sideways to the dog and loosen the leash. </p>\n<p>Don‚Äôt make the mistake of staying in the correcting position with a tight leash and continue to stare strictly at your dog to wait for the next error. </p>\n<p>If you remain tense, your dog will also remain anxious. If in doubt, correct your dog one more time and relax again. This is the only way your dog can learn what kind of behaviour you want him to adopt.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine

You should definitely not blame or punish your dog for this because he only uses the freedom you give him to follow his wishes and needs.</p>\n<p>Dogs that have an excellent orientation around their owner will rarely exceed a certain radius. </p>\n<p>My dog likes to keep a radius of about 10m around me <strong>voluntarily</strong>, so I very rarely need a recall signal for him. </p>\n<p>Nevertheless, in certain situations, <strong>it is essential to be able to recall my dog reliably</strong> (e.g. kids, bikers, joggers, hikers, other dogs, cars, etc.). </p>\n<p>Having a reliable recall is the only way you and your dog can enjoy maximum off-leash freedom.</p>\n<h2>Why Is Your Recall Not Working</h2>\n<h3>Your Recall Is Not Working Because You Are Boring</h3>\n<p>If your dog is allowed to enjoy daily his off-leash activities, even though he does not yet react reliably to the recall, <strong>he will increasingly follow his own wishes and will ignore you</strong>. </p>\n<h4>Why does my dog ignore me?</h4>\n<p>Most times, it is because of <strong>the lack of bonding as well as you are not making yourself interesting</strong> to him. At this point, anything else presents more fun and arises his interest making him choose to ignore your recalls. </p>\n<p>Your dog does not come to your recall signal, because he finds another dog much more exciting than coming back to you? </p>\n<p>This is precisely one of the scenarios you should train specifically for, as other dogs are already a great distraction and much more interesting than you are. </p>\n<h3>Your Recall Is Not Working Because The Fun Is Over</h3>\n<p>Many dogs ignore the recall because <strong>they have learned that the recall means the fun is over</strong>. </p>\n<p>They are called away by exciting things, just to be put on a short leash, making your dog more and more reluctant to come to you. </p>\n<p>Some dogs even look around excited as soon as the recall signal comes because they think they're missing something exciting even though nothing is happening. </p>\n<h3>Your Recall Is Not Working Because Of Your Threatening Body Language</h3>\n<p>The recall is often <strong>yelled out with a particularly stern voice, a serious look and a forward-leaning upper body</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some dog owners think that this authoritarian behaviour improves the chances of success of the recall. </p>\n<p>Most of the time, however, <strong>precisely the opposite happens</strong>. Dogs perceive our body language and voice in great detail. </p>\n<p>The following body language characteristics tell your dog to STAY AWAY:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>upper body tilted forward</strong>, often with both hands at the sides of the hips</li>\n<li>you take a couple of <strong>steps towards</strong> your dog (especially being angry and showing it)</li>\n<li><strong>threatening gestures</strong>, e.g. raised finger, high-pitched authoritative voice, frowning</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Appeasement Dog Behaviour</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Your dog does not approach quickly and joyfully but somewhat <strong>hesitantly</strong>.</li>\n<li>He <strong>walks in a bow</strong> towards you, <strong>lowering his head</strong>, <strong>looking away</strong>, even <strong>sniffin</strong>g something. </li>\n<li>Frequently <strong>licks his lips</strong>. </li>\n<li>The <strong>tail is down</strong>, or even between the hind legs. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is <strong>your dog telling you</strong>: do not hurt me, I am sorry, I am apologetic, look I even turn my head away and don't provoke you. </p>\n<h3>Your Recall Is Not Working Because He Has No Rules and Boundaries</h3>\n<p>As a dog owner, you often provide everything to your dog when it comes to food, toys, attention or petting. </p>\n<p><strong>All the dog's wishes are willingly fulfilled, and any disrespect is quickly forgotten when looking at that cute puppy face.</strong> </p>\n<p>By not creating rules and boundaries inside your house, <strong>your dog gets the smart idea that he is running the show</strong>. </p>\n<p>The boss attitude will transfer to your walks as well, and he will also try to enforce his wishes. He will <strong>only follow the recall if he feels likes it</strong> or the offered reward is suiting him at that moment.</p>\n<p>Dogs that have not learned any rules or boundaries at home will <strong>rarely be diverted from exciting things</strong> in the off-leash time by a recall. </p>\n<p>Your dog won't follow a recall command because he has been making most of the decisions for himself so far anyway, so why change that now. </p>\n<h3>Your Recall Is Not Working Because It Is Not Worth It</h3>\n<p><strong>The recall will only be reliable if your dog is happy to work with you out of an inner conviction</strong>. </p>\n<p>A very unmotivating receiving of your dog in case of a successful recall or only patting the dog's head <strong>is very rarely a motivating reason</strong> for the dog to execute the recall. Especially the patting of the dog's head is often answered with evasive body language, as it is often perceived as unpleasant. </p>\n<p>So your dog neither feels real joy from you, nor is there something worthwhile waiting for him when he arrives at you. </p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5BpiwzXQAEkklJVrorsHwh/453a2c23b8a90f8c6d26b9c5c7c82ec5/_DSC1718.jpeg\" alt=\"How Can I Train My Dog To Come When Called?\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h2>Basic Requirements For A Successful Recall Command</h2>\n<h3>Mutual Respect</h3>\n<p>__Respectful and free-will cooperation is the basis for a successful recall training. __</p>\n<p>You should be a social partner for your dog on which he will gladly and voluntarily orientate himself. </p>\n<p>If you use positive body-language signals and set limits and boundaries, your dog will be willing to perform the command you give him out of his own motivation. </p>\n<p>You should set limits to pushy and rude behaviour, especially when it comes to food, toys or petting, and show your dog an alternative behaviour. </p>\n<p>In this way, you have set the first stone for the recall training.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/how-to-leash-train-your-dog-or-puppy-in-3-steps\" title=\"Leash Training\">Leash Training</a></h3>\n<p>A dog that pulls permanently on the leash will not have its focus on you during the walk, nor will it have learned to orient itself on you. </p>\n<p>He is predominantly busy with all the stimuli in his environment, so recall training will hardly be successful. So you should first work on proper leash management with your dog before you set up the recall.</p>\n<h2>How To Teach And Consistently Train The Recall Command</h2>\n<p>The first and most crucial step to <strong>change your dog's mindset</strong> is for you to stop trying to recall and start training the recall. </p>\n<p>Start by using a <strong><a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/the-4-best-dog-leashes-in-2020-review\" title=\"Tow Leashes\">tow line</a></strong>. You keep the end of the towing line in your hand for the next few weeks so that your dog cannot get used to any more nonsense. </p>\n<p>With the help of the towing line, he should learn to execute the recall consistently and gives him the guidance of what he needs to be doing.</p>\n<h3>Recall Training In A Distraction-Free Environment</h3>\n<h4>Step 1</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Prepare 3-5 pieces of high-quality rewards and leash your dog.</li>\n<li>Walk a few steps with your leashed dog through the apartment.</li>\n<li>With a loose leash turn around and walk backwards 2-3 steps inviting your dog to come towards you. </li>\n<li>When your dog arrives at you: <a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/how-to-clicker-train-your-dog-the-best-way-in-7-steps\" title=\"Clicker Training\">Click, Mark &#x26; Reward.</a></li>\n<li>Repeat this step until you run out of food and finish the 1st training session. </li>\n<li>Since your dog is on a leash, you can practice this step in a quiet garden or on very quiet parts of the walk, parallel to training in your home.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Step 2</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Prepare 3-5 pieces of high-quality rewards and unleash your dog.</li>\n<li>Start by being in the same room with your dog and call him to you.</li>\n<li>When your dog arrives at you: <a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/how-to-clicker-train-your-dog-the-best-way-in-7-steps\" title=\"Clicker Training\">Click, Mark &#x26; Reward.</a></li>\n<li>Repeat this step until you run out of food.</li>\n<li>Repeat this several times throughout the day and practice on several consecutive days. In the garden and on the walk, continue to practice step 1, keeping your dog on a leash.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Step 3</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Prepare 3-5 pieces of high-quality rewards and unleash your dog.</li>\n<li>Go to another room in your home and call your dog to you.</li>\n<li>When your dog arrives at you: <a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/how-to-clicker-train-your-dog-the-best-way-in-7-steps\" title=\"Clicker Training\">Click, Mark &#x26; Reward.</a></li>\n<li>Repeat this step until you run out of food.</li>\n<li>If your dog comes running to you immediately, praise and reward him extensively. </li>\n<li>Vary the rooms and extend the distance in small steps over the next few days. </li>\n<li>If your dog does not come or comes only very hesitantly, practice step 1 and step 2 for a while until these steps go smoothly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Recall Training Outside</h3>\n<h4>Step 4</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Prepare 10-15 pieces of high-quality rewards and leash your dog. Use a 10m tow line. The towing line ensures that your dog cannot ignore the recall at any time, despite the distance. </li>\n<li>During the first few days of training, you only call your dog when he is on his way to you or when he is looking at you. If he is distracted by sniffing the ground or something similar, you do not call him yet.</li>\n<li>When your dog arrives at you: <a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/how-to-clicker-train-your-dog-the-best-way-in-7-steps\" title=\"Clicker Training\">Click, Mark &#x26; Reward.</a></li>\n<li>Repeat this step until you run out of food and finish the 1st training session. </li>\n<li>If your dog runs towards you, take a few steps back to invite him towards you and express your happiness by smiling an being joyful. Praise and rewards abundantly. </li>\n<li>Include about 4 to 5 such recall exercises in each walk.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your dog should learn from the beginning that he has to stay with you until you release him. If he wants to run away immediately after the reward, hook a finger into the collar or harness. As soon as he waits calmly, you can release the finger, and with an OK (or release command) you can release the tow line to its full extent for your dog again.</p>\n<h3>Recall Training With Added Stimuli</h3>\n<h4>Step 5</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Prepare 10-15 pieces of high-quality rewards and leash your dog. Use a 10m tow line. The towing line ensures that your dog cannot ignore the recall at any time, despite the distance. </li>\n<li>Create a list of stimuli in advance that will distract your dog lightly, moderately and strongly.</li>\n<li>If your dog reliably follows the recall signal up to step 4, you now can add well-dosed distraction stimuli. </li>\n<li>Start the recall training with light distraction stimuli and reward your dog extensively if he follows the recall despite this light distraction.</li>\n<li>If the recall with light distractions is successful in at least 9 out of 10 cases, then increase the distractions to medium intensity. Only use the recall in situations where your dog can successfully master the recall.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In case of <strong>to severe distraction stimuli</strong>, where the recall using the command definitely will not work, you should draw attention to yourself otherwise. You can also get your dog's attention back by clapping his hands, clicking, blowing a whistle, fro some dogs also works you going away. </p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/66FEdPq9RCS91f72QdHGWq/d9249da4decf9d51e4148b2972958512/DSC_0824.jpeg\" alt=\"How Can I Train My Dog To Come When Called?\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h3>Recall Training Fixes - Distraction By Other Dogs</h3>\n<p>In these weeks, ask the help of different dog owners to show up with their dogs at various locations while you train recall on the tow line with your dog. </p>\n<p>If your dog looks at the other dog, you tell him that you decide whether your dog is allowed to contact the other dog or not. The towing line is to prevent the dog from ignoring your call back and unintentionally running to the other dog.</p>\n<p>When I say \"you tell him that...\" doesn't mean that you sit down and start a monologue with your dog. It means you ask for his attention (with a previously learned command like \"look\" - the dog needs to make eye contact with you - or a GENTLE tug of the line) and allow him a couple of seconds to decide whether he comes to you or not.</p>\n<p>If he decides to come to you instead of pulling you towards the other dog, then celebrate this moment like it is new years eve. Give him five treats instead of one or take out his beloved tug rope or ball and throw him a party. </p>\n<p>If he decides to pull your towards the other dog, then you say no, turn around and move into the opposite direction. Increase the distance between the dogs and try again. </p>\n<p>Every dog has a so-called comfortable radius around them. This is a space where they can ignore, or react less to other dogs and making this the area where you can have a high success rate with your commands. </p>\n<h3>Recall Training Fixes - The Fun Is Over</h3>\n<p>Your dog should always connect the recall with something positive.\nTherefore, use the recall moderately, but regularly and occasionally, even without an obvious reason. </p>\n<p>Motivate your dog with a joyful voice and inviting body language when he makes his way to you after the recall. Once he arrives at you, your dog should not anticipate what happens next. </p>\n<h3>Recall Training Fixes - Welcoming Body Language</h3>\n<p>If you want your dog to run to you gladly and joyfully when you call him, you should apply the following characteristics for an inviting body language:\nconfident but friendly tone when pronouncing the callback\nsmile and show a joyful expression (dogs recognise the owner's emotional state very well by his facial expressions)\nstraight torso\ntake 2-3 small steps backwards when the dog runs to you\nif necessary, squat down when he arrives where you are</p>\n<p>If you are not sure what your body language looks like, practice at home in front of a mirror, ask others to tell you or film yourself. </p>\n<p>Do not forget to smile. Smiling is not smiling if you are boiling inside. Some sensitive dogs pick up on the energy your let out, so be honest. Practice calming exercises. </p>\n<h3>Recall Training Fixes - The Voluntary Return</h3>\n<p>A voluntary orientation of your dog towards you is achieved by your dog recognising you as a competent social partner. </p>\n<p>This requires neither commands, food nor toys, but only your sovereign action and a solid bond between you two.</p>\n<p>First of all, you should make sure that specific rules apply in the house, which you should enforce consistently and confidently with your dog. </p>\n<p>You should also consolidate these rules of behaviour on the walk. Once your dog has understood these \"new\" rules for living together, he will be happy to comply with the recall.  He will now willingly and voluntarily cooperate with you and recognise you as a competent social partner.</p>\n<h3>Recall Training Fixes - The Dog's Self Motivation</h3>\n<p>Activate your dog's self-motivation by communicating to your dog that he is the most fabulous dog in the world because he has executed the recall.</p>\n<p>However, your dog should not be able to anticipate what will happen after the recall but should be excited. As soon as he arrives, you will have a reward that will bring your dog joy. </p>\n<p>Vary the rewards according to the situation, because nothing is more boring than a recurring reward.</p>\n<h2>Rewards In Dog Recall Training</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>He may go back to sniffing off-leash or in the maximum radius of the towing line.</li>\n<li>Put on a shorter leash, but reward him with 5-6 pieces of high-quality treats.</li>\n<li>Play tug of war with your dog.</li>\n<li>Play ball with your dog.</li>\n<li>Socially interact with your dog. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>When <strong>rewarding</strong> your dog, be mindful of what makes him happy and be creative about the rewards. Mix them up and keep him guessing.</p>\n<p>The more exciting and fun you are after the recall, the more your dog will enjoy the recall.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Secure your dog with the towing line and use the recall during the next weeks really only in situations you can control. </p>\n<p>If your dog has already ignored the current recall signal more often in the past, decide on a new recall word or a dog whistle. </p>\n<p>Parallel to the recall training, you should work on becoming the point of reference for your dog. </p>\n<p>Once you have worked out your dog's voluntary cooperation, the recall on the walk will automatically become a minor matter.</p>\n<p>A successful recall training requires a lot of time, patience and consistency. Depending on the type of dog, recall training varies in complexity and can easily take several months. </p>\n<p>Get support from a local dog trainer if you do not see any success in the training.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>GOLDEN RULE OF TRAINING:</strong> Always, and I mean ALWAYS, finish in good spirit a training session. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"üçÇHiker Girl \nüê∂Thor, the GSD and Belgian Malinois mix, is my soul dog\nüì∑Humble Photographer\nü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yogi\nüå†Stardust\n‚òï üç´ü•ëLover\n\n"},"authorImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=566&h=566&q=50 566w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"authorSlug":"alexandra","authorName":"Alexandra"},"createdAt":"2020-06-14T11:50:50.693Z"}},{"node":{"updatedAt":"2020-05-03T11:00:03.493Z","postTitle":"How To Walk Your Dog?

What could be better than playing with a buddy you encounter on the walk? </p>\n<p>If the dog was socially safe during one encounter with one dog, it could be the other way around when it meets another dog.

The two dogs eye each other with scepticism from afar, they approach each other rather slowly to check out the other carefully. </p>\n<p>As a <strong>general rule</strong>, dog conflicts are not designed to kill to go directly for the kill, because that also can mean self-injuring.\nTherefore, the two dogs try to make themselves as large as possible by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>raising their hairs</strong> on their back;</li>\n<li>carrying their <strong>tail high over their back</strong>;</li>\n<li>moving <strong>stiffly</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If two dogs don‚Äôt like each other, people should call their dogs and just continue their walk separately. </p>\n<p>However, if the dogs already engaged with each other, retrieving one dog from the other dog can be interpreted as a <strong>weakness</strong> and can even lead to an attack. Here, before it becomes really critical, both people should continue their walk <strong>without speaking</strong> and move away from each other. This allows both dogs to separate without showing weakness.</p>\n<p><strong>Insecure dogs</strong>, in particular, often try to avoid social contact. They do not want a fight and see a danger in any encounter with a stranger who they cannot assess from a distance.</p>\n<p>Also do not allow your dog ever to run up frontal to another dog. That is rude and frighten insecure dogs, which might run away and get in trouble (e.g. run on a street and get hit by a car). </p>\n<p>The best way to <strong>help a frightened dog</strong> when another dog runs up frontally is to put the leash on and step in front of it and send the other dog away. This alone will deepen the trust your dog has in you, and you show your dog that you can protect him. </p>\n<p>Honestly, it shouldn‚Äôt come to such situations at all. Not all the people out there are responsible dog walkers (they might be awesome dog lovers, but they suck at dog walking, behaviour and communication).</p>\n<p>Next blog will help you understand and master the art of two dogs meeting and how you can help them be succesful at it. </p>\n<p>Related Blogposts:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/my-dog-is-anxious-on-walks-the-theoretical-part\">My Dog Is Anxious On Walks -

"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>The Instincts of a Dog</h2>\n<h3>Sexual Instincts</h3>\n<p>It is all about the art to reproduce and ensure race continuity.  This will generate an aggressive behavior between intact males - male with male interaction -  as well as between intact females - female with female interaction. </p>\n<p>This can lead to a fight between the dogs if, for example, two intact males meet each other and the owners don‚Äôt pay attention.</p>\n<h3>Pack Instincts</h3>\n<p>This instinct makes your dog a team player giving the dog a superhero power skill in communication. Due to this instinct, your dog becomes adaptable, a quick learner and a very good observer.</p>\n<h3>Hunting Instincts</h3>\n<p>This instinct ensures the dog the food and water it needs to survive.</p>\n<h3>Territorial Instincts</h3>\n<p>Ohh this is a big one. You can see it at every corner‚Ä¶literally. Together with the sexual instinct, these are the two most common triggers for aggressive behavior.\nThe dog shows this instinct by marking the boundaries of what he thinks it is his territory and by being aggressive towards strangers. Intruders in the territory threaten resources and therefore pose a life-threatening danger.</p>\n<p>Imagine yourself lying in the sun, snoozing off in a comfy chair and all of a sudden you open your eyes and there is a stranger in your garden. To avoid that unpleasant and fear causing situation you build a fence.</p>\n<p>Dogs can not build a fence. They go around their territory and mark it by urinating on bushes,  poles, trees, etc. Notice what your dog does while just going around the corner with it. Most probably pees like 10 times. That is marking territory.</p>\n<p>If you think that the dog‚Äôs territory ends at the gates, you are wrong. His territory is also around the corner and two streets down your house as well. So when a human or another dog comes towards your dog and stares at it, what do you think will happen?\nClash of the titans doggy style. </p>\n<p>And here comes our responsibility as dog owners with knowledge: we need to tell and teach our dog how our world and society works. Only we, as responsible dog owners, can give our dog the security and trust it needs to not act territorial and be aggressive.<br>\nAgain it comes down also on the breed you own and the dog‚Äôs personality. </p>\n<p>Some dogs are more territorial than others, but with good leadership, you can work and control the behavior. Some breeds, are by their genetics, territorial: Herding and Working dogs, but even Terriers and Hounds. Some examples: German Shepherds, Malinois, Collies, Australian Shepherd, Rottweiler, Bobtail, Sheltie, Newfoundland, Corgi, Kuvasz, etc. </p>\n<h3>Genetics</h3>\n<p>There are probably a zillion doctorate papers on dog genetics, so I am not going to write one in this blog. </p>\n<p>Just keep following things in mind: a dog breed was bred for a specific work. It is in its blood, as they say, to behave, think and react in a certain way. Some behaviors you can not change and you can not reprogram thousand of years of genetics in one dog. </p>\n<h3>Self - Perception, Show - off and Status</h3>\n<p>In some areas we, humans, must admit we do more damage than help. Some dogs can get to think they are the king/queen of the neighborhood just because they do not get the proper boundaries at home. I only say the little prince or princess that throws a fit because another dog dares to cross THEIR path and pee on THEIR grass. </p>\n<p>Same goes also for if your dog has the highest status in the family. I have a question for you: who takes who on a walk? Is it you, the human in lead, or are you being pulled from one tree to another by your dog? </p>\n<p>Some dogs were bullied when they were younger, so they think now ‚Äúlet me be the first that attacks, that way I will not be bullied and that makes me feel good‚Äù. What this means is, don‚Äôt go with your dog on the street holding in one hand a leash and in the other your phone and expect your dog to behave. You allow your dog to take the lead and be the ‚Äúgrown-up‚Äù, protect you and the territory. </p>\n<h3>Lack of Socialisation</h3>\n<p>Some opinion favors the puppy training sessions, some don‚Äôt. Bottom line is that you can take your dog to puppy school and still become aggressive and you can not take your puppy to puppy classes and have zero issues or the other way around. YES, you should socialize and train the minute you get your puppy. </p>\n<p>If you missed socialization during the puppy months, you still can socialize your dog at dog parks or on the daily walk. This is not a call for letting your dog loose so that it can run up to every dog it sees. Patience and time come in play here. Go out, sit near a dog park. Observe your dog‚Äôs behavior. Find a well behaved and stable dog and make a careful introduction on neutral territory. </p>\n<h3>Boredom</h3>\n<p>Some dogs do get aggressive because they are plain and simple bored. </p>\n<p>Examples of activities that you and your dog can do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Play Fetch with Frisbee, Ball, any other safe toy. Not with sticks or stones.</li>\n<li>Dummy training: make your dog search for its toy or food. </li>\n<li>Hike </li>\n<li>Swim</li>\n<li>Jog</li>\n<li>Bike</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Loss of Control</h3>\n<p>With the loss of control, I mean more or less the loss of freedom - being leashed. Some dogs do have a problem with being leashed because they feel they can not run or protect themselves in case of a threat. This brings us back to the weather you can provide your dog‚Äôs basic needs, in this case, safety and trust that you can provide the protection that is needed. </p>\n<p>The moment these dogs get off-leash they assume a controlling behavior by circling, sniffing, imposing, domination behavior towards other dogs, rough ‚Äúplay‚Äù. As previously stated, taking the dog off-leash will just allow the dog to solve the situation differently, but it will not solve the cause of the problem.  </p>\n<h3>Low Frustration Threshold</h3>\n<p>Other dogs simply lack patience when they are on a leash to get to where they want to go, get off-leash, go to the other dog, etc. This kind of aggression can backfire towards the owner. Simply do not fulfill all your dog‚Äôs wishes. Be also mindful if you do every day the same route and the same exercises. Dogs learn fast when you keep to the same routine and start getting impatient. </p>\n<h3>Hormones</h3>\n<p>The same thing as with humans honestly. One day you have the sweetest kid ever, next day kid can‚Äôt stand you. Puberty. Dogs have it too. Impressing other dogs, being rough, eating boundaries, even running away. </p>\n<p>My dog had a best friend. It was a male Ridgeback and they played, ran, swam, ate together. Until they reached puberty. Both of them are intact males and during the walks, they started showing aggressive behavior to the point that their play sometimes turned to rough body checks and growls. The Ridgeback‚Äôs owner and I then decided that the two of them are better off walking separately. </p>\n<h3>Food, Toys, and Play Mates</h3>\n<p>Dogs can be or can get possessive. Possessive with owners, food, toys, and even their playmates. Also, this behavior can be well corrected with patience and time. </p>\n<h3>Stress</h3>\n<p>Lack of sleep can cause dog stress and make the dog snap in moments less expected. Some owners take their dogs from dog park to agility training, swim and massage session and end up with a jogging hour. You want to keep the dog busy. Well yes, I get it. A dog needs a job and exercise, but the dog also needs a lot of sleep per day. In my opinion, if it goes over 3h daily workout it stressful. Nothing against the day-long beach or hikes, those activities will not keep your dog in a constant state of excitement.  </p>\n<h3>Insecurity and Fear</h3>\n<p>An insecure dog will try to seam though when on the leash and the moment the owner drops the leash they act as nothing happens or they turn aggressive because an attack is the best defense. </p>\n<p>Fear is the next step of insecurity. While being insecure your dog will try to control the situation, if the dog is fearful it will be flight or fight program. There is no way for you to do exercises, teach the dog if the dog is in a state of fear. There is only the survival instinct that is it. </p>\n<h3>Trauma</h3>\n<p>If dogs could speak‚Ä¶ I leave it to that. Trauma happens due to physical or psychological mistreatment induced to the dog by either humans, objects or other animals.  If you know exactly what happened, you can work better in healing the trauma. If you don‚Äôt, it will take a while to figure out all the triggers that lead to aggressive behavior. Patience and time. </p>\n<h3>Sickness</h3>\n<p>Chronic pain can cause aggressive behavior. Tumors, accidents, even imbalance in the thyroid can lead to pain thus aggressive behavior. Know where your dog is, what it chews on, where it plays, how it plays. Do yearly check-ups to prevent medical issues and be responsible for what your dog eats. </p>\n<h3>Environmental Influences</h3>\n<p>Environmental influences such as noise, agitation or dogs in the neighborhood can cause stress and thus aggression in dogs. Even wearing a muzzle because it is the law in some countries can lead to aggressive behavior. You try going out on the street with a muzzle. You notice right away people staring at you judgmentally. </p>\n<p>Last but not least people judge a dog by breed, collar even size. Can they be called racists? And of course, the dog knows when people dislike him, stare at him, even hate him at first sight. So that influences his energy.</p>\n<h3>Learned Behaviours</h3>\n<p>As stated before, sticking to the same routine makes a dog learn a certain behavior. If this behavior is repeated a certain amount of time, then your dog will learn it.\nLet‚Äôs say your dog is dog reactive and 99% of the dogs have dog tags that make a certain sound. Your dog learns that the sound of the dog tags is another dog, so your dog will react even though it did not see any dog yet. Probably were just your neighbor‚Äôs keys. </p>\n<h3>Wrong Associations</h3>\n<p>A dog can associate the pain caused by the corrections done by the owner through a prong collar, e-collar, or just pulling hard on the leash with the incoming dog. So each time a dog comes around, he knows: foreign dog = pain leading to an aggressive reaction. Be mindful with corrections, be gentle and be fair. </p>\n<p>There is no need to be pissed at your dog for 3 hours. Dogs don‚Äôt do that. If you look at a mum with pups you will see correcting them with a growl. The action is when it is needed, at the right moment, for that moment. After that, all is good again and everybody is back at being themselves. I understand some human work differently, but wouldn‚Äôt be nice to NOT carry that shit around? Just try. </p>\n<h3>Aggressive Environment</h3>\n<p>An aggressive owner leads to an aggressive dog. Remember that dogs are superheroes at observing so they can mirror good out own behavior.\nIn the next blog, I will give you the solutions I worked out in dealing with aggressive dog behavior.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"üçÇHiker Girl \nüê∂Thor, the GSD and Belgian

"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Unfortunately, your dog does not care if you are disappointed with him or feel embarrassed if he does not obey. He also does not know that he is ungrateful when he behaves badly, although you love him so much, provide shelter, food, and water.</p>\n<p>A dog doesn‚Äôt know what is allowed and what is forbidden, good or bad in the same way we understand these words.</p>\n<p>A dog basically only differentiates between safe and dangerous. Don‚Äôt take this personally, not blame your dog for this kind of behavior. This is how dogs simply are.\nDogs don‚Äôt make their behaviour dependent on how you feel about certain things and behaviors, only on what brings immediate advantage or disadvantage to himself. </p>\n<p>This means, yes your dog loves you in his own way and whatever he does it is not because he wants to annoy you, plots a revenge or wants to conquer and rule the world.</p>\n<p>The magic formula is:</p>\n<p><strong>Command ‚Äì> Wanted Behavior ‚Äì> Marker ‚Äì> Reward.</strong></p>\n<h2>So how can you successfully communicate to your dog what is good and what is bad?</h2>\n<p>There are several methods, and these methods find their roots in the behavioural psychology. </p>\n<h2>Conditioning Dog Training</h2>\n<p>The conditioning is a type of learning that linked with a sort of stimulus leads to a behaviour and response. </p>\n<p>The behavioural science makes a distinction between classical and operant conditioning. </p>\n<h3>Classical Conditioning Dog Training</h3>\n<p>Classical conditioning involves forming an association between a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus that naturally and automatically produces a response. </p>\n<p>Salivating in response to the smell of dinner cooking in the oven is an example of unconditioned stimuli. Your response to these things takes place automatically without any learning, thus the name of unconditioned response.</p>\n<p>There are 3 phases to the classical conditioning:</p>\n<h4>Before Conditioning</h4>\n<p>A naturally occurring stimulus will automatically elicit a response.\nKeeping to the same example as above: salivating in response to the smell of food is a good example of a naturally occurring stimulus.\nDuring this phase of the classical conditioning, the <em>unconditioned stimulus</em> (smell of food) results in an <em>unconditioned response</em> (salivating).</p>\n<h4>During Conditioning</h4>\n<p>A <em>neutral stimulus</em>is included in the equation and <strong>repeatedly paired</strong> with the <em>unconditioned stimulus</em>.\nTaking the example of Pavlov‚Äôs dog: each time the dog received food a bell rang. </p>\n<h4>After Conditioning</h4>\n<p>Once the association between the <em>neural stimulus</em> and the <em>unconditioned stimulus</em> has been established, presenting now the conditioned stimulus alone will evoke a response even without the unconditioned stimulus. The resulting response is known as the <em>conditioned response</em>.</p>\n<p>Coming back to Pavlov‚Äôs dog: the sound of the bell (<em>neutral stimulus</em>) was repeatedly paired with presenting the food bowl (<em>unconditioned stimulus</em>) to the dog. When Pavlov only rang the bell (<em>neutral stimulus</em>), without presenting the food bowl, the dog started salivating (<em>conditioned response</em>).</p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5jGmFQ6hckQDy65npzBhzJ/9cca66d45adffe86e85fcd5757887de1/IMG_0154.png\" alt=\"IMG 0154\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h3>Operant Conditioning Dog Training</h3>\n<p>Operant Conditioning is a method of learning that occurs through rewards and punishments for a behavior. An association is made between a behavior and a consequence for that behavior.</p>\n<p>Operant conditioning relies on a fairly simple premise - actions that are followed by reinforcement will be strengthened and more likely to occur again in the future.\nConversely, actions that result in punishment or undesirable consequences will be weakened and less likely to occur again in the future.</p>\n<h2>What is Conditioning Dog Training?</h2>\n<p><strong>Classical Conditioning</strong> is a pretty straight forward way of teaching your dog a certain behavior and response to a stimulus. </p>\n<p>By linking sounds, gestures and event together your dog learns to respond to auditory or visual signs and to understand the meaning of certain gestures, words or situations.\nExisting links become weaker with time if they are not constantly refreshed. </p>\n<p>Lets say your dog barks each time the doorbell rings. Well, if you press the doorbell a hundred times without anyone coming, your dog will barely react to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Operant Conditioning</strong> is the method best described: trial and error. When your dog has a goal, he will try different behaviours like barking, jumping, sitting, standing still, scratching, etc until he sees that one behaviour give him what he wants.</p>\n<p>Example: your dog is playing with his ball and this rolled under the sofa. Now he wants his ball back, but he can not reach it. He will try pawing, scratching, pulling, whining, nudging your with his nose and whatever facilitates his way to the ball he will remember. </p>\n<p>Let's say you stood up and took the ball out and gave back to him. Now he knows: balls under sofa, go nudge and human will get the ball. </p>\n<h2>How To Train Your Dog?</h2>\n<p>The answer lays in combining the two conditioning trainings. Classical and operant conditioning are both important learning concepts that originated in behavioural psychology. </p>\n<p>The operant conditioning, however, lays the foundation for the reinforcement training method.</p>\n<h3>Reinforcement Dog Training</h3>\n<p>You can understand negative and positive in dog training by their  mathematical meaning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Positive means something is added to the dog</li>\n<li>Negative means something is subtracted (taken away) from the dog</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These terms refer to what is happening around the dog as consequences of the dogs behaviour.</p>\n<h4>Positive Reinforcement Dog Training</h4>\n<p>A favorable event or outcome presents itself after a certain behavior. </p>\n<p>In situations that reflect positive reinforcement, a response or behavior is strengthened by the addition of something, such as praise or a direct reward. </p>\n<p>Positive reinforcement is giving a reward (attention, food, touch, play) immediately following a behavior that you like and want to see more often. This way your dog learns that good things happen to him when he does certain things only. </p>\n<p>Positive reinforcement teaching techniques use non confrontational methods to work your dog‚Äôs brain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rewarding positive behavior</li>\n<li>establishing rituals that enables your dog to provide a good and wanted behavior (setting him up for success) </li>\n<li>establishing training that enables your dog to provide a good and wanted behavior (setting him up for success)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using positive techniques to change undesirable behavior requires that you first determine the cause of the behavior and then figure out how to modify and change it by giving the dog the ability to learn, feel safe and prevent situations that will lead to the unwanted behavior.  </p>\n<p>People learn to connect with their dogs and work through problems in a human manner ‚Äì strengthening the relationship by fostering mutual trust, providing affection, and encouraging cooperation.</p>\n<p>Timing is crucial when delivering rewards for behavior, this means <strong>the reward needs to come within seconds of the good behavior.</strong> </p>\n<h2>Positive Reinforcement Dog Training Rules:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Avoid intimidation, physical punishment and/or fear.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Studies show that if you use punishing training methods, your dog will not work out of desire and joy, but it will even lead to either more aggressiveness or fearfulness from the dog. Simply put, if you are trying to fight fire with fire someone will get burned.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOld school‚Äù training methods that promote punishments, will argue that jabbing the dog‚Äôs ribs, or yanking the leash, or using electric shock will not particularly damage the dog. It is up to you honestly if you wish to use this kind of methods, but there is no excuse for causing another living being pain. </p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Understand dominance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The most important thing for you as dog owner to understand is that your dog's misbehavior is actually very rarely a result of an attempt for him to assert dominance over you. Nor does your dog thrive for world domination in his spare time.</p>\n<p>Dog behaviour issues arise because owners have no idea how to communicate and how to understand their dog and from a misbalance in safety, trust and guidance between dog owner and dog. </p>\n<p>And no, your dog is not a wolf. He might have wolves as very far away ancestors, but evolution did make big changes in a dog‚Äôs behavior. </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Change perspective: see it from the dog‚Äôs point of view.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Dogs communicate using a complex language of body signals that reflect what they are thinking and feeling. </p>\n<p>They use these signals consciously and unconsciously to communicate intent and ensure their personal safety by affecting behavior in others.</p>\n<p>It is our responsibility as dog owners to learn the body language of our dogs in order to live in balance and harmony. </p>\n<h4>Negative Reinforcement Dog Training</h4>\n<p>The removal of an unfavorable event or outcome after the display of a behavior.\nIn situations that reflect negative reinforcement, a response or behavior is strengthened by subtracting (removing) something considered unpleasant.</p>\n<p>One example of negative reinforcement is when the dog‚Äôs hips are pushed downwards to force the dog into a sit, and then released once the dog is in a sit. Assuming the behaviour of sitting goes up in frequency, the behaviour was negatively reinforced by the removal of the pressure on the dog‚Äôs hips.</p>\n<p>In a study about aggression in dogs conducted by R. A. Casey, the use of positive punishment and/or negative reinforcement was associated with an increased risk of aggression of 2.9 times for aggression towards family members, and 2.2 times towards unfamiliar people outside of the house. In this study barking, lunging, growling, and biting were all considered to be aggression.</p>\n<p>The study of Deldalle and Gaunet looked specifically at the use of negative reinforcement in dog training.</p>\n<p>This study compared dogs taking an advanced dog training class at two different schools: one that used positive reinforcement and one that used negative reinforcement. The dogs had already completed a basic dog training class at the same school.</p>\n<p>Negative reinforcement was used to teach loose leash walking by tugging on the leash while the dog was at a distance from the owner, and stopping tugging when the dog was close by. </p>\n<p>Sit was taught by both pulling the leash up and pushing the dog‚Äôs bottom down and only releasing when the dog was in the sit position. </p>\n<p>Positive reinforcement was used to reward the dog for doing the right behaviour, whenever the dog shows it by itself without using any form or coercion.</p>\n<p>The results showed that dogs in the negative reinforcement group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rarely looked at their owners when walking on leash, compared to those taught with positive reinforcement.</li>\n<li>Showed more mouth licks and yawns when practicing the ‚Äòsit‚Äô command, and were more likely to have a low body posture, all signs of stress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The study concludes that training dogs with positive reinforcement is better for the human-canine relationship than using negative reinforcement.</strong></p>\n<h4>Positive Punishment Dog Training</h4>\n<p>Known as punishment by addition, this form of punishment represents the addition of an unfavorable event or outcome in order to weaken certain behaviour.  </p>\n<p>So positive punishment means adding a punishment (and by no means I mean inflicting ANY kind of violence) after the dog did a behaviour that makes the frequency of that behaviour go down.</p>\n<p>In everyday language, some of the positive punishments get called ‚Äúcorrections‚Äù. For example, tugging on the leash because the dog did not sit when you asked him to. You added pressure to the leash, i.e. collar.</p>\n<p>The  study of Herron, Reisner, and Shofer found an aggressive response from the dog when people use positive punishment: 11% of dogs when use of a prong or choke collar was applied; 15% when the owner yelled ‚Äúno‚Äù at his dog, and 43% when the owner hit or kicked his dog.</p>\n<p>The use of aversive training techniques is a risk factor for aggression towards strangers and family members shows the research of R. A. Casey.</p>\n<p>And the thing that surprises some people the most is that people who report having used positive punishment to train their dog are more likely to report problem behaviours (Hiby, Rooney and Bradshaw).</p>\n<p>According to the research conducted by Emily J Blackwell people who used a shock collar report less successful training than they expected.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the European College of Veterinary Clinical Ethologists issued a position statement calling for electronic collars to be banned across Europe. </p>\n<p>The American Veterinary Society for Animal Behaviour says <em>‚ÄúResearch shows that dogs do not need to be physically punished to learn how to behave, and there are significant risks associated with using punishment (such as inhibiting learning, increasing fear, and/or stimulating aggressive events).</em></p>\n<p><em>Therefore, trainers who routinely use choke collars, pinch collars, shock collars, and other methods of physical punishment as a primary training method should be avoided.‚Äù</em></p>\n<h4>Negative Punishment Dog Training</h4>\n<p>Known as punishment by subtraction (removal), this form of punishment occurs when a favorable event or outcome is removed after a behavior occurs. </p>\n<p>Negative punishment is done by removing something the dog values, thus decreasing the possibility of the dogs behavior repeating in the future. </p>\n<p>A good example is neglecting to give the dog attention when he jumps on you, where ‚Äúattention‚Äù is what you‚Äôre taking away from the dog. Negative punishment is much more effective for this problem behavior. </p>\n<p>The dog jumps up, you <strong>remove</strong> yourself (and your attention), and the behavior decreases because there is no reward. You can easily take a step backwards and turn away from your dog when he jumps up. </p>\n<p><strong>Negative punishment should not disrupt the bond you have with your pet.</strong> </p>\n<p>When you withdraw your attention, or yourself, in response to a ‚Äúbad‚Äù behavior, do so for not much more than a minute. Prolonged social isolation may cause stress and anxiety. </p>\n<p>As with positive reinforcement, timing is important. You must remove the rewarding stimulus within a few seconds of when the behavior occurred.  </p>\n<p>Another issue is <em>human inconsistency.</em> Your dog‚Äôs brain can not deal with inconsistencies.</p>\n<p>For example one day it is raining outside, so you had to wash your dog after your walk. If your dog is always allowed on the sofa, but now, because he is wet, he is not allowed, you will just confuse the heck out of him. In his eyes you will be unpredictable and he might become fearful of your reactions.</p>\n<p>The solution is to think ahead in the beginning, create rules and boundaries that you can be consistent with. If you like to cuddle on the sofa, well if he is wet place 1-2 blankets and be fine with that. </p>\n<h2>The Marker In Dog Training</h2>\n<p>In dog training you will often hear trainers talk about \"marking a behavior\".  <strong>Marking</strong> is when you send a signal to a dog that will be associated with whatever behavior that was just performed. </p>\n<p>The signal will be used to either encourage or discourage that behavior.\nWhen the signal is used to encourage a behavior it is called a \"positive marker‚Äù and when it is used to discourage a behavior it is called a ‚Äúnegative marker‚Äù. </p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5sbF7KCTPNAhDomvjER61E/c72a89d2606b972ffe056b52912e5edb/_MG_5542.jpeg\" alt=\"MG 5542\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h3>Positive Markers In Dog Training</h3>\n<p>Positive markers are any sounds that tell your dog that he did a great job. You can either use a word or a clicker for this. </p>\n<p>Word like ‚ÄúGood dog\", \"YES!\", \"YIP\", a clicking sound with your tongue or any other word you can think of ca be used as a positive marker. </p>\n<p>If you want to use a word as your Marker, make sure it is short and sharp, and it comes naturally to you when you are pleased. </p>\n<p>The marker word shouldn‚Äôt be similar to your dog‚Äôs name and also shouldn‚Äôt be a word you use 100 time a day. That will just confuse your dog.</p>\n<p>The little plasticky device that makes a distinct and sharp noise it called a clicker.\nA clicker is a great tool because it has all the above characteristics. But it is a device you must take with you when you want to train. </p>\n<p>The great advantage is that the sound is unique to your dog and can not be misused or confused and it is consistent in tone and length.</p>\n<h4>How To Teach Your Dog The Marker</h4>\n<p>This is going to be the easiest thing you ever thought your dog!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wait for your dog to display wanted behaviour.</li>\n<li>Mark the wanted behavior by saying the marker word (or click with the clicker).</li>\n<li>Immediately give your dog a treat.</li>\n<li>You know your dog got it when he looks at you waiting for the treat after the sound occurred. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>See this article to learn <strong>clicker dog training</strong> in depth. </p>\n<h3>Negative Markers In Dog Training</h3>\n<p>Negative markers are used to discourage and dissolve unwanted dog behavior. Examples for negative markers are words like ‚ÄúNO‚Äù, ‚ÄúAH-AH‚Äù. The tone is firm and leaves no room for ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù. </p>\n<p>Eventually the negative marker by itself will serve as a conditioned punisher and the dog will restrain from the unwanted behavior when hearing the word used by his owner because of its close association with undesirable consequences: loss of attention, loss of play time, no treats.</p>\n<h2>The Classical Marker Dog Training</h2>\n<p>The classical clicker dog training happens when the trainer tells the dog what to do and the dog performs that command correctly and the behavior is marked and rewarded. </p>\n<p>This requires that the command is already known by dog upfront in order for him to able to provide it. This method can be used more for reinforcing an already known behavior rather than teaching it all new. </p>\n<h2>The Operant Marker Dog Training</h2>\n<p>Contrary to the classical marker dog training, during the operant marked dog training the trainer awaits for the dog to display, even offer, certain behaviors. The desired behaviours will give the dog rewards, the unwanted ones give him nothing or negative punishment (‚Äúignoring‚Äù is applied). </p>\n<p>This form of training allows dogs to be active during training sessions, rather than only have them be ordered around. This doesn‚Äôt mean that the classical method is wrong. It depends a lot on your dog‚Äôs temperament and how he reacts to the training methods. So just be open to both ways and try it out. </p>\n<h2>The Continuation Marker Dog Training</h2>\n<p>The Continuation Marker Dog Training signals the dog to keep doing what he is doing.\nSay you want to teach your dog to fetch his leash prior to the walk. This is a complex series of actins your dog needs to learn. You first break down the action in little exercises and then start linking them together. Once you have a small link, you will stop rewarding each small step alone and switch to reward a chain of actions. </p>\n<p>Some dogs need reassurance that they are doing it right, so you can start using a continuation marker, like ‚Äúyeeeeees‚Äù, ‚Äúgooood‚Äù. When you use the continuation marker word you say it a happy, prolonged intonation and when the chain of actions id done you use your normal marker with the same tone and intensity as you normally do, or use the clicker. </p>\n<h2>The Reward In Dog Training</h2>\n<p>Remember the magic formula Command ‚Äì> Wanted Behavior ‚Äì> Marker ‚Äì> Reward?\nNow is the fun time for your dog: the oh so awaited and wanted reward. Reward is the currency in the dog world. Learn what currency your dog‚Äôs bank desires the most, and you set yourself and your dog up for success. This is called a high value reward. </p>\n<p>Using low value rewards, will not keep your dog as excited as you want during the training sessions. Low value rewards will demotivate and even lead the dog to be bored and go roam and chase squirrels. </p>\n<p>The key is to find out what your dog likes. Some dogs just love food and you can train awesomely a life long with chicken, or high quality dog treats. Other dogs put their preference on toys or human attention. </p>\n<p>But wait, stop for a moment and analyse your dog‚Äôs life style! Yes, I said lifestyle! Some of us have only 1 dog, and he gets fed twice a day, gets tons of cuddles and has toys laying around. What is his currency now? Once you leave the house it is all about the squirrels, cats, other dogs, rest of environment, and pretty much far away from you. This is when Fluffy decides not to return to your when recalled; sorry to say, but in your dog‚Äôs eyes you are boring. </p>\n<p>What happens if you change his life style and remove some of the luxuries? I am not talking about not feeding him, or leave zero toys around, or give no attention to your dog at all. For example find that one toy he is crazy about and use it only for training and only when you and your dog are playing together. This is not a toy to share with other dogs. This is the bond between you and him.  </p>\n<h3>How To Give A Reward During Dog Training?</h3>\n<p>What you should avoid is delivering the reward right into the dog‚Äôs face every time. This may become boring or even frustrating for a dog if your training wasn‚Äôt properly planned and the dog is having issues figuring out what he is supposed to do. </p>\n<p>Because of this, the whole concept may end up being about the treats themselves, instead of being about the interaction with you. </p>\n<p>Regardless of the type of reward, make it an event every time you can when delivering it. After all, that is why it is called a ‚Äúreward‚Äù.</p>\n<h4>Attention</h4>\n<p>Attention is a good reward to use in between bigger rewards. Remember the chain of actions? Use it in between, use it e.g. when you dog is free and he comes to you without you asking him to. Be friendly, use a soft voice, smile and pet your dog. </p>\n<p>Make sure you know where your dog likes to be touched. Not all dogs like to be touched on top of their head, like 99,99% of the people do. By avoiding the unwanted spot you show respect towards your dog and he will trust you even more. </p>\n<h4>Toy</h4>\n<p>As stated above, here we talk about THE toy. The one piece of equipment that makes your dog wag his tail and be super happy when you take it out. C‚Äômon, you all know that behavior. </p>\n<p>So how do you give the toy to the dog? You don‚Äôt just walk and throw it to his paws. No. The toy needs to be earned. </p>\n<p>In your mind return to the classical and/or operant marker dog training. The moment your dog does what you want (either a command or he offers a certain behavior by himself), mark and reward with the toy. </p>\n<p>The toy reward is delivered in such a way that the dog has to catch it in the air, simulating catching a prey. This is a very important part of delivery since it builds satisfaction and motivation for your dog.</p>\n<p>After he caught the toy, maybe lay a couple of seconds (especially it is a tug toy), after that he needs to return the toy to you. This way the toy needs to be earned each time. </p>\n<p>After the training session is done, I personally allow my dog to carry his earning to the car, rest place or until home. He feels really proud doing that and it is a reinforcement for his awesome behavior. Once he is at his place, car, home, etc that toy disappears until the next training session. </p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2mJlsi1HUkxdySDPxXQkgB/0ea10cafa17e25d248bf221d3318fc6a/_MG_9594.jpeg\" alt=\"MG 9594\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h4>Food</h4>\n<p>High value food rewards are meat, cheese, dog food sausages, etc. Normally, high value treats are soft products, although this depends on your dog. </p>\n<p>Every dog has a different taste and what some dogs may find extremely motivating, another may not and even spit it out. You may have to change a few different types of reward treats in order to find what your dog prefers the most.</p>\n<p>Administrating the food reward is similar to how the toy is given, without the play part. </p>\n<h2>Dog Training Guidelines</h2>\n<p>The process of changing a dog‚Äôs behavior using positive reinforcement relies first and foremost on understanding, patience, consistency, and a good amount of repetitions.</p>\n<p>Take into account that puppies have a very short attention span, so make the training sessions short and pleasant. NEVER EVER end a training session with an incorrectly done exercise or any bad mood or angry tone. The last that happens is what your dog will remember and associate with. </p>\n<p>From the age of six weeks, the learning ability of a puppy is fully developed and ready to absorb your teachings like a sponge. </p>\n<h2>Best Dog Training Guidelines</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Identify</strong> why your dog is doing what he is doing. You cannot effectively deal with a behavior unless you know the root cause.</li>\n<li>Once you know why, then you can ask yourself how to treat the behavior. To do this, it is vitally important you <strong>understand</strong> your dog.</li>\n<li>Figure out how to communicate clearly. <strong>Effective communication</strong> increases the bond between you.</li>\n<li>Find what <strong>motivates</strong> your dog and use this while teaching. Rewards in the form of food, toys, praise, or play are powerful, but every dog is different, so find out what motivates your dog the most.</li>\n<li>Never hit, scream at, or yank your dog. Do not combat fear with more fear‚Äîrecognize your dog‚Äôs concerns, then slowly and gently help her overcome them. You wouldn‚Äôt like to be treated like that either, so <strong>be kind</strong>. </li>\n<li>Go slow and be <strong>patient</strong> when dealing with anxiety-related behaviors and allow your dog the <strong>time</strong> he needs to bond and come out of his cocoon.</li>\n<li>Everyone in your dog‚Äôs life must be on the same page and provide <strong>consistency</strong> in training, expectations and reactions. If one person lets your dog on the couch and someone else does not, he will get confused.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"üçÇHiker Girl \nüê∂Thor, the GSD and Belgian Malinois mix, is my soul dog\nüì∑Humble Photographer\nü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yogi\nüå†Stardust\n‚òï üç´ü•ëLover\n\n"},"authorImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=566&h=566&q=50 566w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"authorSlug":"alexandra","authorName":"Alexandra"},"createdAt":"2019-11-16T19:01:13.808Z"}},{"node":{"updatedAt":"2020-04-19T07:00:44.160Z","postTitle":"How To Teach A Dog To Go Sleep?","postSlug":"how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-sleep","postFeaturedImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4988290398126465,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2nifoMpClgVT1IEFz0wUfY/6faa8ea96b4b877a4eb622f825c85203/_DSC0983.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2nifoMpClgVT1IEFz0wUfY/6faa8ea96b4b877a4eb622f825c85203/_DSC0983.jpeg?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2nifoMpClgVT1IEFz0wUfY/6faa8ea96b4b877a4eb622f825c85203/_DSC0983.jpeg?w=400&h=267&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2nifoMpClgVT1IEFz0wUfY/6faa8ea96b4b877a4eb622f825c85203/_DSC0983.jpeg?w=800&h=534&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2nifoMpClgVT1IEFz0wUfY/6faa8ea96b4b877a4eb622f825c85203/_DSC0983.jpeg?w=1200&h=801&q=50 1200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2nifoMpClgVT1IEFz0wUfY/6faa8ea96b4b877a4eb622f825c85203/_DSC0983.jpeg?w=1280&h=854&q=50 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"postDescription":{"postDescription":"Teach Your Dog To Go To Sleep!

"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>How To Walk A Fearful Dog Outside</p>\n<p>One of the things my trainer told me was: \"You are boring for your dog!\". Let me tell you that hit me in my ego sooo bad, but then I reflected and watched other dog-human teams, and I had to admit: I was boring. </p>\n<p>Start your walk with a little exercise that will help your dog pay more attention to you: little tug of war, ball, show your dog the treat bag, hide treats and search together, a good game of fetch. </p>\n<p>Avoid releasing the leash if your dog is pulling on the leash. That will reinforce your dog to pull each time he wats to go somewhere or greet another dog.  </p>\n<p>Let the dog sit, get into a calm state of mind and the release the leash. </p>\n<h3>Dog Anxiety On Walk - Personal Space</h3>\n<p>Simply because the personal space of your dog on the leash is not respected, and the dog is unable to restore it, it can cause unpleasant feelings. Your dog feels pressured, insecure, fearful, thus anxious.</p>\n<p>What your dog is left with, is the possibility of restoring individual distance through aggressive behaviour. Now your dog shows aggression to keep the other dog at a distance. </p>\n<p>If this behaviour succeeds, this confirms the action to your dog that is on a leash, which in return will lead to it becoming increasingly aggressive in the future to prevent encounters with other dogs.</p>\n<p>If a free-running dog is so stormy on the encounter that he physically gives your dog a body check, or even shows aggressive behaviour, this will further increase the problem. </p>\n<p>Now your dog not only has to fear an attack, but he actually suffers one. The leash is supposed to offer your dog security. He should orientate himself on you, rely on your guidance. </p>\n<p>Because the dog now suffered an attack on the leash, he learns that he can not rely on you to protect him, worsening the human-dog bond. </p>\n<p>One free-running dog and irresponsible dog owner will cause your dog anxiety, and set you and your dog, what it might feel like, light-years back in terms of training. </p>\n<p>One way you can show your dog that you can protect him is by stepping in front of him the moment he sees another free-running dog, but your dog is not aggressively reacting yet. </p>\n<p>The moment you step in front, use your dominant and secure voice and with a stern movement of your free arm send the other dog away. This way, your insecure dog learns that you can take over the action, protection, and that he can relax.</p>\n<h3>Dog Anxiety On Walk - Defending A Ressource</h3>\n<h4>Ressource Human</h4>\n<p>If your dog thinks that it has unlimited access to you as his human social partner will also want to enforce these requirements when walking on a leash. </p>\n<p>An approaching foreign dog is then kept at a distance by aggressive behaviour. </p>\n<p>In this case, a change in everyday life in parallel with leash training is essential, because this is the only way to change the dog's fundamentally wrong attitude towards you! </p>\n<p>Actually, such behaviour does not really correspond to leash aggression because the dog also shows this behaviour while free-running.</p>\n<p>You should take a step back and see what is going on at home. Do you two play when your dog is in the mood? Do you cuddle when your dog comes to you? Who greets another human first: you or your dog? </p>\n<p>If your dog sets the pace with you, then you might want to reconsider this arrangement. Start by taking another toy as your dog does for the play, initiate cuddle moments, let your dog sit while you greet another human first. </p>\n<h4>Ressource Reproduction</h4>\n<p>In the case of males, aggressive behaviour is often only shown towards uncastrated males. </p>\n<p>If you look at these dogs while they are off-leash, you can see that they are not really relaxed when encountering same-sex dogs either and often react with aggressive behaviour as well. </p>\n<p>Therefore, the aggressive behaviour on the leash due to sexual motivation is actually not a real leash aggression issue.</p>\n<p>A proper obedience training and \"heeling\" work will do the trick here and allow you to walk by without incident.</p>\n<h3>Dog Anxiety On Walk - Methods On How To Walk On The Leash With An Anxious Dog</h3>\n<h4>Method 1: Avoidance</h4>\n<p>While out on your daily walk together, at the sight of another dog just take a detour, go around the other dog putting enough distance between your dog and the other dog, or just turn around in a relaxed manner and walk back like you forgot something at home or in the car. </p>\n<p>If all the above is not possible, try some food as a bribing method. Something that your dog loves above all other treats he gets. </p>\n<h4>Method 2: Carrying A Prize</h4>\n<p>This is the method that works wonders for my dog. He loves the fetch game, so he always carries a ball or a tug toy. That allows him to chew on it when he gets anxious. </p>\n<p>For this, you need to teach your dog in the first place to fetch and then to hold things. </p>\n<p>Fetching is a beautiful way to bond with your dog as well as it will build trust, and you two can have lots of fun. Once you discover the power of fetching and holding, you will become a fan. </p>\n<h4>Method 3: Look</h4>\n<p>Depending on the level of excitement of your dog, you could teach your dog to look at you and hold the eye contact until you pass the other dog.</p>\n<p>You can also use this in combination with sit and stay commands. It is essential to start this kind of training far enough from another dog to enable a positive experience for your dog. </p>\n<h4>Method 4: Touch</h4>\n<p>The touch command is an alternative for the look command, simply because some dogs have issues keeping extended eye contact with humans. </p>\n<h2>My Dog Is Anxious On Walks - Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In the end, it is all about making those mistakes, failing, trying again and failing better. </p>\n<p>There is no perfect recipe, and what works for one dog might not work for another. </p>\n<p>Make sure you get to know your dog and work on that split moment timing when you reinforce the desired behaviour and when not. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"üçÇHiker Girl \nüê∂Thor, the GSD and Belgian Malinois mix, is my soul dog\nüì∑Humble Photographer\nü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yogi\nüå†Stardust\n‚òï üç´ü•ëLover\n\n"},"authorImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=566&h=566&q=50 566w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"authorSlug":"alexandra","authorName":"Alexandra"},"createdAt":"2019-12-29T14:00:10.084Z"}}]},"contentfulCategories":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Training","categorySlug":"dog-training","categoryDescription":{"categoryDescription":"All you need to know about the theory behind dog training spiced up with practical tipps to improve your dog training skills.
