"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Dog Anxiety - Definition</h2>\n<p>Anxiety in a dog is defined as the anticipation of potential dangers from unknown sources. </p>\n<h2>Dog Anxiety - Causes</h2>\n<p>Most common triggers for anxiety in dogs are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fear - caused by loud noises; unfamiliar people or animals; visual stimuli like hats, trench coats, umbrellas, etc.; new or different environments; specific situations like the vet, car rides, elevators, etc.; unfamiliar surfaces like grass, wood floors, grills, etc. </li>\n<li>Separation - caused by the discomfort that the dog feels when he id left alone</li>\n<li>Illness or Injury - caused by pain, infections, toxicity. </li>\n<li>Age-related - caused by similar signs as in human Alzheimer's disease: loss of memory, awareness, perception.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dog Anxiety - Symptoms</h2>\n<p>Most of the times, the dog will develop behavioural problems and/, or he will depict bodily reactions that are causing his panic, anxiety and fear.  </p>\n<p>Examples of severe anxiety symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>aggression</li>\n<li>drooling</li>\n<li>urinating or defecating in the house, also emptying of the anal glands </li>\n<li>panic</li>\n<li>destruction</li>\n<li>excessive barking and howling</li>\n<li>pacing and restlessness</li>\n<li>repetitive or compulsive behaviours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Examples of subtle anxiety symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>seeking extra comfort or affection</li>\n<li>excessive licking or chewing</li>\n<li>hiding or searching for solitude</li>\n<li>panting and shaking</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dog Anxiety - Manifestation</h2>\n<p>One of the most common symptoms is aggression. There are two types of aggressive behaviour: direct and indirect. </p>\n<p>Dog behaviourists speak about direct aggression when a dog acts aggressively towards another animal or human. </p>\n<p>Indirect aggression happens when a person comes between the dog and the source of the dog's aggression, such as another dog. </p>\n<p>Another common symptom is destruction. This form of anxiety manifestation can lead to costly repairs but unfortunately, can also lead to the dog injuring himself. The dog will concentrate his destructive behaviour around exit points: doors and windows.</p>\n<h2>Dog Anxiety - Treatment</h2>\n<p>First of all, take your puppy to a vet and check him out thoroughly. Do a full blood check and talk to your vet about your dog's symptoms. </p>\n<p>I strongly recommend visiting the vet before giving your dog supplements, oils or any medication to treat anxiety.</p>\n<p>If the vet clears your dog, then you can consider searching for a dog behaviourist and trainer that will help you with your dog's anxiety. </p>\n<p>You might think like: \"so I read all this for a \"go to a specialist.\" advice?\"</p>\n<p>Well yes and no. You now know much more about anxiety and might even know the reasons. But do not underestimate the great help a specialist can provide. They work day after day with issues in dogs. So they have a big backpack full of knowledge and tools. </p>\n<p>There are also training methods you can test by yourself, although. </p>\n<h3>Counterconditioning and Desensitisation Training</h3>\n<p>Counterconditioning is a training method used to change your dog's response to the stimulus responsible for anxiety, and replacing the anxious behaviour with a more desirable behaviour, like sitting or focusing on the owner. Meaning once your dog has been exposed to the trigger, you train your dog to provide another response to it as before. Praise like there is no other best treat on this planet. </p>\n<p>Through desensitization, you slowly introduce your dog to the source of anxiety, preferably in minimal doses and at a decreased intensity. </p>\n<p>Repeated exposure and rewarding positive behaviour can help your dog toward managing anxiety, and you also allow your dog to make choices.</p>\n<p>Desensitization can be an effective method when your dog's anxiety is brought on by a particular trigger like a firework, thunderstorm, car rides, etc.  </p>\n<p>Through repeated exposure and rewarding positive behaviour, your dog will learn to reduce his anxious response to the particular trigger. </p>\n<p>A common mistake that will actually do more harm than help your dog is to try to comfort your dog. This actually makes it worse, because your dog will think you are rewarding him for the anxious behaviour. Instead of comforting your dog, encourage him to act calmly.</p>\n<h2>Dog Anxiety - Prevention</h2>\n<h3>Learn Anxious Dog Body Language</h3>\n<p>To avoid negative experiences for you and your dog, you need to watch and learn your dog's body language. A dog's body will tell you very early what is going on with him. </p>\n<p>Knowing your dog's body language will also help you during counterconditioning, and desensitisation training. It will allow you to reinforce that desired positive behaviour. </p>\n<h3>Socialise Your Puppy</h3>\n<p>Best way to avoid anxious behaviour is to socialise your puppy very early. Let him know people, animals, places, cars, trams, trains, trucks, fireworks, etc. </p>\n<h3>Obedience Training</h3>\n<p>Obedience training is the foundation for an excellent human-dog bond, providing trust and a healthy relationship between the parties. </p>\n<p>Obedience is a crucial tool for managing and even preventing anxiety in your dog. </p>\n<h3>Exercise and Food</h3>\n<p>Provide your puppy with healthy and dog-friendly food and treats. This will keep your dog healthy.</p>\n<p>Exercise is crucial for the dog’s bodily and mental health. Go on that walk, even if you are later home as expected, play with your dog, cuddle. Do not ignore or neglect him since this will lead to anxious behaviour. </p>\n<h3>Avoid</h3>\n<p>And if you find yourself in a situation that you know for sure will escalate, then your best friend is avoidance. Turn around, go into the field, cross the street, avoid dog parks, etc. </p>\n<h2>Dog Anxiety On Walk</h2>\n<p>I will cover in this part, mainly the so-called line aggression since this is one of the most known anxiety out there at the moment.  </p>\n<p>Make peace with the fact that you will make mistakes, your dog will make mistakes, you will be frustrated, at a verge of giving up and scream and run. I have been there. I was sad, angry, terrified and felt like nothing works and helps overcome the line aggression. </p>\n<p>My rescue was a knowledgeable trainer that had a genuine experience with fearful dogs. How did I know he will help? It just felt right. </p>\n<p>He never suggested anything that hurt my dog, he told me honestly what might change and might not, also said to me that part of the problem is my fault and he showed me

need to know about the theory behind dog training spiced up with practical tipps to improve your dog training skills. "}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Why do dogs need a leash?</h2>\n<p>Almost everywhere a dog must be under control at all times, this you can achieve by leashing your dog. This is legal obligation you as dog owner need to meet. Some countries even ask you to put a muzzle on your dog. So if you travel, make sure to read the legal obligations you need to meet.</p>\n<h2>Why does my dog always pull on the leash?</h2>\n<p>Most will say it is because the dog is excited, happy to be outside and wants to get faster to a certain place. While this is partly true, it is also true that the one that is in front leads the way.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the topic of leading your dog on the leash is closely linked to other areas of life: if you do not control your dog on a leash, it will certainly not be controlled in other areas of life.</p>\n<p>But it is also important that your dog can feel your leadership skills in such important situations as leading him on the leash. If you can not enforce your interests on the leash and let yourself be drawn to each blade of grass, then you probably will not be able to do it in other areas of the dog’s life either. You lose competence in your dog’s eyes. The dog will not follow an incompetent boss, especially not when it comes to secure and defend vital resources: protection, living area, etc.</p>\n<h2>How do you train a dog to walk on a leash without pulling?</h2>\n<p>The goal of leading on a leash is that your dog walks behind you on a loose leash - in every situation.</p>\n<p>Your dog should learn that he must pay attention to you and not you to him. At the moment you may be paying attention to him by constantly asking him to come with you, waiting when he wants to put for the 10h time yet another drop of pee on the grass, or just give in to his sniffing and let him follow each small he finds interesting.</p>\n<p>Does this description seem familiar: dog way in front of you, pulling you wherever he wants to go and you stumbling almost behind him with stretched arm?</p>\n<h2>How to stop a dog from pulling on the leash?</h2>\n<p>First of all make peace with the fact that dog training is all about patience, calmness and consistent training.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Training Yourself To Walk Your Dog on a Leash</h2>\n<p>Pay attention to your body language. It should be purposeful and radiate leadership skills: so chest out, shoulder straightened, straight back. Clear your mind of previous bad experiences, breath, YOU can do this!</p>\n<p>Set a fixed goal and walk determined towards that goal. Be consistent. Once you leash your dog, you need to demonstrate your leadership skills.</p>\n<p>Keep yourself calm and assertive while walking your dog. The moment you lose your cool the tension will travel down the leash and it will change the state of mind of your dog.</p>\n<p>My dog was a dog reactive dog and it took me months of hard work (calmness, consistency, body language checks, repetitions) to get to where I am today: walking by dogs without having my dog react, bark, jump, pull etc.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Training Your Dog to Walk on a Leash</h2>\n<h3>Introduce</h3>\n<p>Introduce your dog to the collar and leash. You can let your puppy wear the collar in the house and you can start leash training in the house first. Choose the correct leash and collar for your dog. Make sure you also feel comfortable with holding the leash and it feels good in your hand.</p>\n<p>It is a leash leading etiquette to lead your dog on your left side. Get used to that and get your dog used to that. Because some dog owners do not train their dogs (a total shame in my opinion - it is like buying a 500 horsepower car and drive every day 30 mph), I thought my dog to heel on both sides, just in case I need to switch sides. I have different commands for the different sides and it is a pleasure to be able to adapt to different situations.</p>\n<h3>Teach a Command Word</h3>\n<p>Put the leash on and just make the puppy follow you. You want to teach that cue that you will use later on when you want the dog to be at your side and follow your lead. I use “heel”, but you can use anything that makes sense to you.</p>\n<p>You will start with cue and gesture in the beginning. The gesture is to help your dog understand the cue. Over the course of time the gesture will become less and less and only the verbal cue will remain. This obviously doesn’t apply to deaf dogs.</p>\n<h3>Mark &#x26; Reward</h3>\n<p>When your dog is doing what you want, and please understand that NO dog will make a perfect heel the first time training, then you <strong>mark</strong> the moment and <strong>reward</strong> your dog. It is enough if the dog starts walking only one step next to you. After that you build it up to 2, 3, 5, 10 etc steps before you mark and reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Marker</strong> can be either a clicker or a word. The word must always be the same word, with same length and intonation. This is why some people prefer the clicker.</li>\n<li></li>\n<li><strong>The Reward</strong> is either good ham, chicken, bacon or a toy that is only used for training purposes like a ball, bite tug toy. The reward follows the marker.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 3: Leash-Training Troubleshooting</h2>\n<h3>Pulling</h3>\n<p>Remember why a dog is pulling and walking up front! Yes, desire to get somewhere but it is also because you do not step up as a leader. Check your body language, give the command word and walk like you own the road.</p>\n<p>If your dog starts pulling in a direction, stop and wait for the dog to turn towards you and set him again in the start position - heeling. Give the command again and start walking. Don’t walk only straight ahead. Dogs are not stupid and they kind of know the route and the routine after 5 days. Take another route, the other side of the road.</p>\n<p>Change between side of the roads frequently, when the dog least expects it. Turn and go back 10 steps. Turn left, turn right and so on. Adapt it to where you live and don’t do all the time the same thing.</p>\n<p>When I took my “Canine Good Citizen” Exam (the FCI Version of it), I had to do a certain walking scheme with my dog: walk 12 steps, stop, tell my dog to sit, walk away, turn, go back to my dog and continue with the exercise. After 2-3 weeks of trading I notice that my dog started sitting after the 12 steps before I even got to say sit. Why? Because this little mischievous bundle of sweetness learned “oh heck same thing all the time: after 12 steps I need to sit… here we go, I sit! Boooring”.</p>\n<h2>I became boring to my dog!</h2>\n<p>So I started then switching things up: sit after 5 steps, after 15, after 10, after 20.</p>\n<h3>Lunging</h3>\n<p>If your dog is going after something while on a walk — another dog, a car, or skateboarder, for example, try to redirect his attention to you before he has a chance to lunge and create space between you and the target. Be proactive. Get prepared before the target of his frustration or excitement gets too close.</p>\n<p>This type of behavior is more common in <strong>herding breeds</strong>, who like to chase.</p>\n<h3>Barking</h3>\n<p>Some dogs have the habit of barking at other dogs while on a walk. Oftentimes, this behavior comes as a result of lack of exercise. Make sure your dog gets the proper amount of mental and physical stimulation for his breed. If this is still a problem, use the same process as you would if your dog is lunging.</p>\n<p>Make sure that you pay attention at your dog’s body language. Dogs will tell you long before they react that they will do that. They can’t say “Hey human! See that jogger coming? His shoes bother the heck out of me so I will go for them when he is in reach!”.</p>\n<p>Dogs make a very <strong>light change in their demeanour</strong> to tell what it is going on in their head and if you miss it, then you need to handle the lunging, jumping, barking, etc.</p>\n<p>Time, patience and repetition will make YOU better at reading your dog as well it will give your dog the change to learn what is expected of him.</p>\n<h3>Leash Etiquette</h3>\n<p>Leash laws may require your puppy to walk nicely on a leash and know how to heel when off your property. But, even if they don’t, it’s simply polite puppy behavior to know leash etiquette. With proper leash manners, your dog has more freedom to safely explore the world beyond your front or backyard.</p>\n<p>To those people that are super proud of their off-leashed dogs and are stunned by others that do leash their dogs and shout out ” my dog just wants to play” or ” my dog is harmless”: good for you!</p>\n<p>Not all dogs are the same and if the other person is leashing their dog than be respectful and responsible and do the same. Not the dog owner with the leashed dog has a misbehaved dog, but the one that doesn’t leash the dog.</p>\n<p>Just because your dog is playful and harmless doesn’t mean that the other dog is and wants to do the same things. You don’t go for coffee with everybody either.</p>\n<p>Just because your dog is playful and harmless doesn’t mean that it is true. More often owners don’t know what their dog is doing and what signals the dog is giving to the other dog. </p>\n<p>A dog that does not want to play with others and even reacts dismissively and aggressively does not have a behavior problem, but it is rather a natural dog that just likes to be left alone. You don’t allow everybody on the street to hug you either. </p>\n<p><strong>Refer to my training guide for detailed descriptions.</strong></p>\n<p>Puppies do not instinctively know how to walk on a leash. When you pull, dogs instinctively pull back, and if you allow the pup to win, that can make it even more difficult for them to overcome the urge to do it.</p>\n<p>It is much easier to teach a small puppy than a powerful adolescent or adult. If you have a puppy, then now is the perfect time to teach it to walk nicely on a leash. Begin immediately when you bring the pup home. If you have an adolescent or adult dog, here is even more important to walk like a boss and show your dog you can provide guidance, leadership, protection, food, and fun.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!

Aggressiveness is developed and serves a purpose."},"postDate":"2019-11-13T00:00","postCategory":{"categorySlug":"dog-training","categoryTitle":"Dog Training","categoryDescription":{"categoryDescription":"All you need to know about the theory behind dog training spiced up with practical tipps to improve your dog training skills. "}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Before I even start with all the good information, I need to tell you, dear furry canine friend, to bring out the big guns called <strong>Patience</strong> and <strong>Time</strong>. </p>\n<p>No one can tell you how long you and your dog need to correct and change a certain behavior. With some dogs, it will take a small tuning here and there and then it runs like clockwork, and with some dogs, you will be correcting and working with them for their entire lifetime. </p>\n<p>Be mindful of this and learn to accept the kind of dog you have. The dog is not a machine thus it will never ever be perfect and you are not perfect either. </p>\n<h1>Aggression: is it good, bad or natural?</h1>\n<p>If you look up the definition of aggression you will find the following: “feelings of anger or antipathy resulting in hostile or violent behavior; readiness to attack or confront.” </p>\n<p>Aggressive behavior can cause physical and/or emotional harm to other beings.\nSo reading my statement above you would think aggression = bad. Well not quite. There are different types of aggression and arguably some state that without aggression a race (human or animal) would not have survived. </p>\n<p><strong>AGGRESSION IS A NATURAL BEHAVIOUR AND AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR INSURING THE SURVIVAL.</strong></p>\n<p>When, for example, your dog reacts aggressively towards a foreign dog that enters its territory, by no means is your dog aggressive. This is a natural and instinctual behavior towards survival that the dog displays. It is up to you, as its owner, to teach the dog the society’s rules you expect him to follow and exhibit. </p>\n<p>A dog will utilize aggression only if necessary and not because it is it’s favorite pastime. I believe the “Schutzhund” training is not a training to satisfy the dog’s aggressions need. Aggression is not like hunger or thirst. It doesn’t need to be satisfied in that manner. </p>\n<h1>Aggressive Behaviour Examples</h1>\n<p>Noncontact Behavior: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixation of another dog</li>\n<li>Laying down in a hunting position</li>\n<li>Cutting off the path of another dog </li>\n<li>Growling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contact Behavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rumbling</li>\n<li>Nipping</li>\n<li>Bitting</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Leash Aggression</h1>\n<p>We talk about leash aggression when a dog shows signs of aggression mainly against another dog, during the period of being on the leash. </p>\n<p>Be aware that some dogs will only behave aggressively as long as they are on a leash.  The moment they are off-leash all seems to be solved, but do not be fooled. It does not mean that the problem the dog has, does not exist anymore when it is off-leash. The dog will just solve its issues differently. Maybe the behavior of the dog changes when the leash is released, but not the attitude it has.</p>\n<h1>On and Off-Leash Etiquette</h1>\n<p>To those people that are super proud of their off-leashed dogs and are stunned by others that do leash their dogs and shout out “ my dog just wants to play” or “ my dog is harmless”: good for you! Not all dogs are the same and if the other person is leashing their dog than be respectful and responsible and do the same. Not the dog owner with the leashed dog has a misbehaved dog, but the one that doesn’t leash the dog.</p>\n<p>Just because your dog is playful and harmless doesn’t mean that the other dog is and wants to do the same things. You don’t go for coffee with everybody either.\nJust because your dog is playful and harmless doesn’t mean that it is true. More often owners don’t know what their dog is doing and what signals the dog is giving to the other dog.</p>\n<p>A dog that does not want to play with others and even reacts dismissively and aggressively does not have a behavior problem, but it is rather a natural dog that just likes to be left alone. You don’t allow everybody on the street to hug you either.\nIn the next blog, I will lead you through the root causes of aggressive dog behavior to give you a better understanding of why a dog does what it does.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"🍂Hiker Girl \n🐶Thor, the GSD and Belgian

"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>A clicker is a small device that makes a consistent, discrete clicking sound when you press it.</p>\n<p>Some make a very sharp sound, some make a softer clicking sound. Clickers work because they provide a consistent and reproducible signal that indicates to the dog in training that he has just earned a reward.</p>\n<p>The clicker also bridges the time gap between the dog’s behavior and the delivery of the reinforcing reward. </p>\n<p>It might take only a second or two to deliver a treat to your dog’s lips when he sits in front of you and you have clicked a clicker, but if you are teaching him a command at a distance, the click of the clicker lets him know that what he is doing is the behavior that has earned him a reward, which he will enjoy as soon as he returns to you or you go to him.</p>\n<h2>Charging The Clicker for Dog Training</h2>\n<p>Before you do anything with clicker training exercises, you need to explain to your dog what the clicker is. The way that you do this is called, charging the clicker.</p>\n<p>This means that you will pair something that is meaningless or neutral to your dog (like the click from a clicker), with something that has meaning to the dog (like food).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The easiest way to do this is to put some treats on the counter beside you, then get your dog’s attention, <strong>and then simply click and treat</strong>.</li>\n<li>Continue charging the clicker this way for at least 20 repetitions. You can repeat this twice a day for a couple of days.__ After two days of charging the clicker__, test your dog.</li>\n<li>Test this in another location away from where you normally train and without presenting treats to your dog. Have just a few treats in your pocket without your dog noticing them.</li>\n<li>Then, out of the blue <strong>“click”</strong>. You will know by your dog’s response if he has connected the marker with the oncoming treat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If he acts excited and expects a reward, he has connected the sound of the clicker with the follow reward.</p>\n<p>If he is hesitant or doesn’t react at all, he still didn’t get it. No problem! Simply do a few more charging the clicker training sessions, and test again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is ALL about the timing with conditional training. If you present the treat before you click or if you click after the dog is already eating the treat, your dog will not make the association between the clicker’s sound and the reward.</li>\n<li>During the phase of charging the clicker you don’t ask your dog to perform any action like sit, down, etc. Your dog is simply learning the meaning of the clicker: click = reward.</li>\n<li>Click or mark only once. The purpose of the clicker is to mark the specific behavior in the moment when it occurs, nothing more nothing less. If you click multiple times you will face issues when you start more demanding exercises, because your dog won’t understand which behavior he is getting the reward for. So confusion sets is, leaning to frustration on your and the dog’s side.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How To Clicker Dog Training</h2>\n<p>Here is the magical formula:</p>\n<p><em><strong>(Command –>) Wanted Behavior –> Clicker –> Reward</strong></em></p>\n<p>The reason I used <strong>“command”</strong> in brackets is simply because if you start with a puppy and he knows no commands at all, then you may take the operant conditioning training method to deliver the marker click.</p>\n<h3>Find a Quiet Spot</h3>\n<p>In the beginning you want your dog’s undivided attention, so it’s best to find a quiet spot in your home where it is only you and your dog. You’ll also find it best to eliminate as many distractions outside the training area as possible. </p>\n<h3>Operant Behavior</h3>\n<p>Keep your clicker and a handful of treats handy, and whenever you catch your dog doing something you like, simply click and treat. You may be surprised at how quickly your dog can learn new behaviors this way.</p>\n<h3>Give the Command</h3>\n<p>Keep your clicker and a handful of treats handy, give the command you want your dog to perform and the moment he did it click and reward.</p>\n<h3>Reward Small Progress</h3>\n<p>Let’s say you want your dog to learn to hold an object in his mouth. The first thing a dog might do is look at the object. Click and reward. After that he might touch it with the nose. Click and reward. After that he might open his mouth just a little bit. Click and reward. You see where this is going. Keep it small and reward the behavior that is going towards the goal.</p>\n<h3>Build the Behavior</h3>\n<p>Sticking with the example above, if your dog touches the object and opens his mouth and hold the object just for 1 second, now you click and reward. This was a chain of actions he did correctly and it shows the dog the direction of the exercise.</p>\n<h3>Reward the Full Behavior</h3>\n<p>Once your dog has the object in his mouth and holds it proudly awaiting for the click, you can choose to extend the period of time he holds the object and then click and reward. Make sure to vary the time. Dogs are super smart and I swear they can count and tell when it is time for you to click and reward.</p>\n<h3>Remove the Clicker</h3>\n<p>Once the behaviour is well established, and the dog does it and understands the command, it is time to stop the clicking. The clicker is only a training tool. It is not meant to be used forever. The rewards also will vary and will not come after each time the behavior is displayed. Keep it interesting for you dog and keep your dog guessing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!

theory behind dog training spiced up with practical tipps to improve your dog training skills. "}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>But how to withstand the cuteness of a puppy to enable a well behaved adult dog?</p>\n<p>It is always nice people visiting. And that visit will certainly come when your new puppy is at home, “maternity visit”.</p>\n<p>That is great fun, but how you approach it when your puppy is 8 weeks old lays the foundation for how your dog behaves towards visitors once he has grown up.</p>\n<p>Most people do not want their dog to jump up against the visitors, and most visitors do not like it when your dog jumps against them wearing their neat clothes.</p>\n<p>Although most visitors will say the first two months when your puppy is still small that they do not mind it, even then it is still important to stick to how you want your puppy to behave.</p>\n<p>Your puppy can learn this later on in life to of course, but that is not entirely fair to your dog. It causes confusion as something that was always allowed suddenly is no longer allowed.</p>\n<p>Make friends and family clear before you come in what you expect from them. It is terribly difficult to do that when a lovely, lively and enthusiastic puppy comes running towards you. Nobody can resist that, so clarity in advance is best.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to train your new puppy in showing the wanted behaviour. The first way is with a leash and the second you use a bench.</p>\n<p>Whichever is easier for you, you should use but both need to be followed exactly, no matter if the visit is expected or unexpected, first your puppy then your visitors.</p>\n<h2>The Leash Way</h2>\n<p>If you want your puppy to learn to stay on the ground with four feet when letting in and greeting visitors?</p>\n<p><em><strong>You can go through the following steps to reach this goal.</strong></em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make a note on the door with the text: <strong>I’m training the dog, please wait, I’ll be right there.</strong> Like to immediately walk inside when the door opens.</li>\n<li>Make sure there is a pot with super tasty rewards near the front or back door, sofa and the kitchen table.</li>\n<li>Put your puppy on the leash or lift it under her arm. The dog leash is preferred.</li>\n<li>Walk to the door and grab the reward.</li>\n<li>Open the door and just look at your puppy!</li>\n<li>Give the little reward to your puppy while your visit arrives. Your visit must be a moment of attention to the pup.</li>\n<li>When your visit is in, you also take your puppy inside. You let your puppy sit if that goes already. If this does not work yet, hold him tightly on his harness or collar and give a reward if he stays calm.</li>\n<li>When people are allowed to greet you give your puppy permission before your puppy can say hello. Make sure your visit is small to say hello so that your puppy does not have to jump.</li>\n<li>After greeting you, you lure your puppy away with a reward. In this way you teach your puppy that greeting takes a while and that comes with you, away from people, which yields goodies.</li>\n<li>Give your puppy some treats to chew on or lay your puppy in the run with some treats. Visitors are not allowed to interfere with the pup. It will then become the most normal thing for your puppy to grab his treats and lie down.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You repeat this recipe every time a visitor arrives. Don’t let your visit make your puppy crazy, because that’s probably not what you want him to do later when he grows up.</p>\n<p>Walk quietly to the front door, let visitors come in undisturbed and then say hello quietly is a nice greeting for both people and dogs. No jump and hassle, that’s not necessary.</p>\n<h2>The Bench Way</h2>\n<p>If you do not find it convenient to take your puppy to the door, then using a bench, run or even a connecting door to the corridor is an option. In this case you can do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Makes a note on the door with the text: <strong>“I’m training the dog, please wait, I’ll be right there.”</strong> In this case, your visit does not have to enter immediately, so it does not have to be on the note.</li>\n<li>In this case you provide a pot with tasty rewards close to the front or back door, the couch and the kitchen.</li>\n<li>Place your puppy in the bench or run, preferably before the doorbell rings. If the doorbell rings before your puppy is in the bench or run, take the time to put your puppy in the bench or run (if you do well you have a note hanging on the door). At the moment you say quietly “place” and give some treats in the bench or run.</li>\n<li>Now walk quietly to the door and let your visit in.</li>\n<li>When letting in your visit, explain that you would like them to initially leave your puppy alone. Do not ask your visitor to walk to the puppy, not to make eye contact with him or to enter into a conversation at a distance.</li>\n<li>Drop a reward in the bench or run when your visit is in and stay close to the bench or run. You regularly drop a small reward or give it to your puppy through the bars.</li>\n<li>When your visit has quietly taken place on the couch and your puppy has also chosen to lie down or sit quietly in the bench, it is time to let your puppy out off the bench or run. You can do this on a leash, but you can also walk along with the pup to the visit without a leash. Lifting is also an option but not advisable.</li>\n<li>Hold your puppy calmly and let the visit say hello one by one in a calm way. Meanwhile, you reward your puppy with tasty food for four legs on the floor. You can guide this by gently holding onto the harness or collar.</li>\n<li>After the greeting, your puppy will get a tasty bone to play with. Visitors are not allowed to interfere with the pup for a moment, so it will become the most normal thing in the world for your pup to take a bone and start chewing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Repeat this list the next time so that your puppy learns how to deal with visitors. This way you can prevent your puppy from learning to jump.</p>\n<p>A nice side effect of using a bench or run is that your puppy learns to go to his place when the bell rings. That ensures peace for you, your puppy and your visit, not a circus when the doorbell rings.</p>\n<p>If there is an unexpected visit, always take the time for your puppy. Your puppy will learn through repetition and success. Investing the first few months in the behaviour you want will pay you back when your puppy is an adult.</p>\n<p>Your visitors will have to wait at the door for a second, and they will appreciate if they can come and visit you during the rainy season for a cup of tea or coffee, without getting muddy feet on their clothes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!

"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Why Should You Crate Train A Dog?</h2>\n<p>Crate training a puppy gives you a big advantage since it will tap into the dog’s den instinct. The idea behind this is that the crate becomes your dog’s “den” and allows him/her to have a place to take refuge, relax, and sleep.</p>\n<p>Due to this “den” effect, crates can be used effectively to assist in housebreaking as well. A dog inherently won’t usually want to use their sleeping area as a potty. Dogs naturally relieve themselves outside the perimeter of their living areas. Being enclosed in a crate provides the motivation for most dogs to “hold it” until let out to relieve themselves.</p>\n<p>Additionally to aiding in potty-training, crate training a dog creates calm and balanced energy inside your home, instilling appropriate boundaries in the house, and setting the dog up for success by reducing their ability to participate in destructive or nuisance behaviors.</p>\n<h2>How To Crate Train Your Puppy</h2>\n<h3>STEP 1: Introduce</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Find that good spot for the crate in your house (not too loud and busy) and lay an absorbent pad in there (puppies are not yet potty-trained so accidents may happen).</li>\n<li>Place some toys in there and leave the door open.</li>\n<li>Puppies are curious and eager to investigate, so sit down near the crate call the puppy or allow him/her to enter the crate by themselves. It is easier to create a positive association if the dog enters alone in the crate. NEVER force the puppy in the crate, or use it as punishment.</li>\n<li>Once they have entered the crate on their own free will, praise them gratuitously.</li>\n<li>Continue this process every few hours so the crate becomes a happy place.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STEP 2: Mark &#x26; Reward</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>After a couple of times (and I personally do it most of the time from the get-go) you introduce a gesture for “Go into your crate”.</li>\n<li>After the puppy enters you mark the good behavior with either your marker word or clicker, then reward the puppy either with treats, toys, voice and/or attention/love.</li>\n<li>This conditioning should be repeated many, many times and always with a positive vibe to it.</li>\n<li>The gestures and commands must always be the same and consistent.</li>\n<li>The rewards should vary, in the beginning rarely, but as they grow more often you give no reward just praise with voice and attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STEP 3: Closing The Door</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Once your puppy is happily entering and exiting the crate on his/her own, start closing the door for a few seconds.</li>\n<li>Repeat this step as long as your puppy is interested and not distressed by the door being closed.</li>\n<li>*ery gradually increase the amount of time the door is closed.</li>\n<li>Repeat every few hours until your puppy is happily sitting in the crate for a few minutes at a time.</li>\n<li>If the puppy starts winning then you pushed over his boundary. Take a step back and leave the door closed for a shorter period (it might sometimes mean only close and open directly).</li>\n<li>No rewards/attention/talking if the puppy is whining.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STEP 4: Feed Meals In The Crate</h3>\n<p>This is actually an additional step in case you have a sensitive puppy that is not really feeling safe in the crate or had a bad experience. This step also applies if you want to leave your puppy several hours in the crate when he/she will be an adult and your dog will need water or even food for that time spent in the crate.</p>\n<p>So if you need this step then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place the puppy’s bowls in the crate (food and water).</li>\n<li>Once the puppy starts eating and drinking quietly close the door.</li>\n<li>Once he/she finished the food let the puppy out again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Throughout Steps 1-4 you need to remain near the crate and observe your puppy and invest the work into the training, but I promise if you take your time while they are puppies you will have a laid back time when the dog is an adult.</p>\n<h3>STEP 5: Leave The Room</h3>\n<p>Before you attempt this step make sure that your puppy was outside to release itself, you allowed the puppy to run, you played and did some basic obedience training. Note that for a puppy this takes about 15 minutes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send your puppy to his/her crate with the gesture and command.</li>\n<li>Mark &#x26; Reward the good deed.</li>\n<li>Close the door on the crate and leave the room for a short amount of time. It is sufficient to just leave the room so that the puppy can not see you and return directly.</li>\n<li>There is no need to throw a party when you come back. If you do, your dog learns that he needs to get excited when you enter the door. Right be cute when they are small, but not what you want when they are adults.</li>\n<li>Be calm, go open the door, praise and give attention.</li>\n<li>Do not open the door if the puppy is whining.</li>\n<li>Leave toys in the crate in case they need to do something while you are gone, but if you already went out with the puppy, and trained, and played they will most probably fall asleep.</li>\n<li>If the puppy falls asleep, then you only open the door when it wakes up again.</li>\n<li>Gradually increase how far away you go and how long you are out of the room. Don’t move too fast.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- !\\[puppy crate training](../images/three.jpg) -->\n<h3>STEP 6: Leave The House</h3>\n<p>If Step 5 is really comfortable for your puppy, and you provided the basic needs of your puppy (potty, training, and play) then you can advance to step no. 6 – leaving the house.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put the puppy about 15minutes before leaving the house in the crate. If you need to say “goodbye” (this is only for our as human, dogs don’t understand that), then now is the time to do it. Say all the love words you need, cuddle, hug and kiss and put the puppy in the crate.</li>\n<li>When you leave don’t talk or look at the puppy anymore just leave. You start with 5min outside the building and you build it up to a max of 4-5h if necessary.</li>\n<li>When you return you are calm, no wild and loud “hellos”. Preferably you leave the puppy another 5 minutes in the crate and then you let it out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STEP 7: Create A Daily Schedule</h3>\n<p>Dogs learn fast and they learn best if you follow routines. So even if you have a vacation for the first couple of weeks when the new puppy arrives, set up and follow your workday routine as much as possible.</p>\n<h2>Example routine:</h2>\n<p>Waking up at 6 -> go to the bathroom -> get dressed -> take the dog out -> come back after potty and some training (some more or some less depends on your dog energy level) -> serve clean and freshwater to the dog -> prepare the dog’s food -> place the bowls in the crate -> let eat and drink and settle down. Now in the meantime, you do your own things and then crate -> go out.</p>\n<h2>Potential problems</h2>\n<h3>My Dog is Whining in His Crate, What Should I Do?</h3>\n<p>If your dog whines or cries while in the crate at night, it may be difficult to decide whether he’s whining to be let out of the crate, or whether he needs to be let outside to go potty. If you’ve followed the training procedures outlined above, then your dog doesn’t need to potty and he/she is only crying so that he(she is allowed out again.</p>\n<p>If that is the case, try to ignore the whining. If your dog is just testing you, he’ll probably stop whining soon.</p>\n<p>Do NOT yell, hit the crate or anything. Ignore until it stops. When the whining stops for y couple of minutes and the dog relaxes and lays down, then you open the door.</p>\n<p>Remember to not go too fast, since this will decrease your success rate and most likely produce a whining and fearful puppy.</p>\n<h3>Separation Anxiety</h3>\n<p>Separation anxiety cannot be treated or abated by crate training. Separation anxiety is a disorder that affects many dogs. Often, these dogs will go, almost literally, out of their minds when they are left alone. It is severe, debilitating anxiety; it is often accompanied by attempts to escape the house, resulting in damage and destruction of items in your home in the process.</p>\n<p>You can treat separation anxiety, but it can only be treated by very slow desensitization and counter-conditioning training. It takes a very long time to desensitize a dog with separation anxiety.

behind dog training spiced up with practical tipps to improve your dog training skills. "}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Bad Equipment</h2>\n<h3>Head Collars</h3>\n<p>This piece of equipment was produced out of helplessness. Owners try to redirect the dog’s attention, but let’s be honest here: it does not solve the problem.\nProbably the dog’s nose is towards the owner but its eyes and attention not.</p>\n<h3>Flexible Leashes</h3>\n<p>If you have one, throw it away. Why would you have a leash at which your dog can pull? So not only he is leading you but he also learns leash = pulling and be the leader. This might be worse leash you could own honestly. Sorry if someone’s feelings are hurt, but there is no grey zone with dogs. </p>\n<h3>Spray Collars, E - Collars, Prongs, and Co.</h3>\n<p>Just No. I have seen other trainers use all kinds of equipment, but I am just not fond of equipment that produces pain. If your kid is misbehaving do you taser him or her? </p>\n<h2>Good Equipment</h2>\n<h3>Collars</h3>\n<p>Grab a sturdy wide collar. It should be one that you can adjust to fit it to your dog’s neck. </p>\n<h3>Leashes</h3>\n<p>Take a long enough leash that can hang like a U between you and the dog. I prefer this length because I can maneuver around and still have a loos leach on my dog. </p>\n<p>The collar + leash combo is similar to taking your kid’s hand and going out. Through this combination, you communicate to your dog EVERYTHING so take your time and choose a good fit for both of you. </p>\n<h3>Food and Toys - Motivational Equipment</h3>\n<p>Motivational equipment is key in dog training. Have the dog’s favorite food or its favorite toy with you at all times. Teach your dog to carry its toy or food bag. </p>\n<p>You can change your walks into little hunting adventures: hunt for food, look for the toy, Get creative! You and your dog will love it. </p>\n<h3>Body Language</h3>\n<p>This is the most important one! You can not lead a dog if you don’t feel confident in yourself. Why should the dog trust you and think you can keep it safe if your energy is not strong? </p>\n<p><strong>Be confident.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Be assertive.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Be present - don’t play with your phone.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Be a leader.</strong></p>\n<h2>How To Stop Dog Aggression Guideline</h2>\n<h3>Activity</h3>\n<p>Lack of activity can lead to lethargy, depression, restlessness, and even aggression. The best remedy is to give the dog a job. Physical and mental employment are awesome. With less than 16 hours of sleep per day, a dog can start to get stressed. So the question arises of what is the right job for the dog. </p>\n<p>You should always pay attention to the instincts of the dog and its individual preferences. A hound will love if you will engage in hunting activities with him, like hunting for its food. You could hide a dummy fool with food and make the hound search for it.</p>\n<p>A herding dog will go crazy chasing balls, frisbees for example, which is also a form of hunting. </p>\n<p>Man-trailing for those dogs that love to work with their nose. Agility training for the Aussies and Collies. </p>\n<h3>Increase Frustration Threshold</h3>\n<p>Does a dog pull on the leash to get to a specific peeing spot, jumps out of the cars as soon as the door opened, runs out of the gate or house for as soon as it cracks open a bit, or even jumps and run the moment you take the leash in your hand? If the answer is yes to at least one of those situations, then the dog has a very low frustration threshold. </p>\n<p>The solution is teaching the dog patience. Examples: if you take the leash and the dog is jumping and so on, then the leash goes back in its place. Try 5 min later. Tell the dog to sit calmly. If the dog does it then the leash goes on. If not leash goes away. Same idea with house and car doors. If the dog doesn’t sit the door closes again. Be consequent for about 1 week and you will see that the dog understands “if I am calm, I get the good stuff” idea. </p>\n<h3>Good Leash Skills</h3>\n<p>I will try to paint a picture in your head with words. Your body language has to be as follows:</p>\n<p>Square shoulders, gaze forwards, chest up, chin up. The arm attached to the hand that holds the leash is relaxed and down. The leash in your hand is held with no tension or strength, just laying loose in your palm. </p>\n<p>The dog is on the left side sitting with his entire body behind the line of your feet. It’s head at your leg. By the way, the left side comes from the hunting times back in the days when the dog was on the left side of the hunter because on the right side they had the hunting rifle. </p>\n<p>You will notice that people that train their dogs will keep their dogs on the left side. People that don’t train their dogs have a dog walking all over the place with no structure. You can teach your dog to walk either left or on the right side so that no matter who you have in front of you, your dog has structure and you lead the dog through the encounter.</p>\n<p>When you start walking, you give the command (heel or walk or whatever word you have for the dog following you) and start walking with the same leg that is near the dog - left if the dog sits left, right if the dog sits right. This helps the dog a bit to get into the movement. Don’t pop the leash and give the “heel” command at the same time - you will just confuse the dog. </p>\n<p><strong>Leash popping is for corrections only, not for commands.</strong></p>\n<p>In movement, the dog has to adapt to your speed, not you to his. Be aware of that.\nWhen you stop, the dog stops and either assume a sitting position by default or stands depends how you teach the dog. </p>\n<h3>Obedience</h3>\n<p>Obedience training is the key to success. Success is having a good recall, having a calm dog, having a good walk, having a balanced relationship with your dog. </p>\n<h3>Territorial Responsibility</h3>\n<p>Territorial responsibility is when you allow, probably unconsciously, your dog to take responsibility for the house and/or garden. This behavior can lead to aggressive behavior like jumping on guests, barking at guests, jumping and barking at people and dogs passing near the fence. The dog can even “terrorize” the owner and the family in their own house. You as an owner need to step up here and regain control by showing your dog boundaries. </p>\n<h3>Keep a Cool Head</h3>\n<p>Easier said than done. This will take patience and time for you to learn how to keep calm and walk on. This means instead of reacting directly negatively and this your dog will notice right away, try to tell yourself “I Got This!”, start whistling, laughing whatever makes it possible for you to redirect the negative into positive and allows you to stay in charge. </p>\n<p>Remember that your dog observes you ALL the time you are around him/her, so your dog knows exactly when you are anxious, nervous, calm, happy, angry. </p>\n<h3>When To Intervene</h3>\n<p>The timing and the manner you intervene to correct a dog is crucial. It is impossible to describe the right timing in a blog because it depends entirely on the situation, location, dog, owner, personalities. If your work by yourself, have a family member or friend film you. See your mistakes on video and try to improve for the next walk. </p>\n<h3>Praise</h3>\n<p>Make it easy for the dog to succeed. The easier it is, the more the dog will succeed and the more positive feedback it gets.  </p>\n<h3>Correct</h3>\n<p>It is your responsibility as an owner to provide the dog with the social structure it needs to be able to function in human society. </p>\n<p>When you correct you can do it by popping the collar, by blocking the dog’s path, by changing direction (such a powerful maneuver) or you can touch your dog to snap him out. Be mindful in case your dog redirects the aggression towards your hand.</p>\n<p>Important is a sovereign, targeted, authentic and controlled correction. You want to have a direct success with the correction. However, should your correction attempts have zero effect, it is pointless to continue. Sometimes corrections can escalate the situation making it even worse. </p>\n<p>If you use a correction way too many times you can make your dog immune to that correction. This might even make you amplify the correction, which is not recommended at all.</p>\n<h3>Educate Through Bonding</h3>\n<p>Paying attention to your dog’s needs and fulfilling them leads to a wonderful bond that will last a lifetime. Achieving the bond will change your dog’s behavior. Your dog will pay attention to you, if he runs free he will look back all the time to see where you are, it will be game-changing.</p>\n<h3>Change Behavior</h3>\n<p>A behavior change in your dog means a behavior change in you. Your dog acts and reacts because of how you act and react. It is you, as a responsible owner, that needs to adapt to the dog’s needs and be able to create an environment fit for the dog you have. It is similar a bit with getting a baby. With a baby, you have the responsibility to care for it, feed it, etc. </p>\n<h3>Dog Buddies</h3>\n<p>Although you might have the impression that with an aggressive dog, there is no way to find a dog buddy for yours, I have a different opinion. There is always another dog around that will tolerate yours, and even teach him some manners. So head high, talk to different dog owners, try (safety first), and your dog will find a buddy as well. The best experiences I had were always with the opposite sex as my dog’s. </p>\n<h3>Distractions: Snacks, Toys, and Co.</h3>\n<p>All the distractions on the planet will not solve your problem honestly. You can get your dog fat, distract with the ball, and the moment the bribe is gone you have a dog that is throwing a fit again. I don’t say they don’t work at all. You can use them to pass a dog or distract, but the root cause of the reactivity stays. Teach your dog a solid “heel” command and have a good leash skill and that will help you more than bribing.</p>\n<h3>Systematic or Flooded Desensitisation</h3>\n<p>Desensitization in a dog means that you add slowly, and start will small doses, a trigger to the dog’s environment to make him immune to that certain trigger. You can do that with other dogs if yours is dog aggressive, with the doorbell, with the sound of fireworks, etc. </p>\n<p>My dog was afraid of the car. So each time I wanted to get him in the car, I could see on his body language that he would rather run 100k than get in the car. So I started getting him in the car, giving him a snack, and get back out. The next step you turn the engine on, stay in the parking lot, then off and done. Days later we took a ride and all was good. This is called a <strong>systematic</strong> desensitisation. </p>\n<p><strong>Flooding</strong> means you put the dog in the middle of whatever bothers him and let him stay there until, some people say, the dog will be cured. Since the dog can not run away, nor hide, the only thing he can do is resign. Not a fan of this method honestly.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Not one method fits all dogs. You need to test, try and fail, try and succeed until you find the methods that work for your dog. If a trainer is trying to tell you his method is the one and only, listen, try it, and if it doesn’t work for your dog, move on.\nRemember it takes patience and time to succeed, but it worth every minute.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"🍂Hiker Girl \n🐶Thor, the GSD and Belgian Malinois mix, is my soul dog\n📷Humble Photographer\n🤸‍♀️ Yogi\n🌠Stardust\n☕ 🍫🥑Lover\n\n"},"authorImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=566&h=566&q=50 566w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"authorSlug":"alexandra","authorName":"Alexandra"},"createdAt":"2019-11-16T19:21:13.477Z"}}]},"contentfulCategories":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Training","categorySlug":"dog-training","categoryDescription":{"categoryDescription":"All you need to know about the theory behind dog training spiced up with practical tipps to improve your dog training skills.
