Let me tell you that hit me in my ego sooo bad, but then I reflected and watched other dog-human teams, and I had to admit: I was boring. </p>\n<p>Start your walk with a little exercise that will help your dog pay more attention to you: little tug of war, ball, show your dog the treat bag, hide treats and search together, a good game of fetch. </p>\n<p>Avoid releasing the leash if your dog is pulling on the leash. That will reinforce your dog to pull each time he wats to go somewhere or greet another dog.  </p>\n<p>Let the dog sit, get into a calm state of mind and the release the leash. </p>\n<h3>Dog Anxiety On Walk - Personal Space</h3>\n<p>Simply because the personal space of your dog on the leash is not respected, and the dog is unable to restore it, it can cause unpleasant feelings. Your dog feels pressured, insecure, fearful, thus anxious.</p>\n<p>What your dog is left with, is the possibility of restoring individual distance through aggressive behaviour. Now your dog shows aggression to keep the other dog at a distance. </p>\n<p>If this behaviour succeeds, this confirms the action to your dog that is on a leash, which in return will lead to it becoming increasingly aggressive in the future to prevent encounters with other dogs.</p>\n<p>If a free-running dog is so stormy on the encounter that he physically gives your dog a body check, or even shows aggressive behaviour, this will further increase the problem. </p>\n<p>Now your dog not only has to fear an attack, but he actually suffers one. The leash is supposed to offer your dog security. He should orientate himself on you, rely on your guidance. </p>\n<p>Because the dog now suffered an attack on the leash, he learns that he can not rely on you to protect him, worsening the human-dog bond. </p>\n<p>One free-running dog and irresponsible dog owner will cause your dog anxiety, and set you and your dog, what it might feel like, light-years back in terms of training. </p>\n<p>One way you can show your dog that you can protect him is by stepping in front of him the moment he sees another free-running dog, but your dog is not aggressively reacting yet. </p>\n<p>The moment you step in front, use your dominant and secure voice and with a stern movement of your free arm send the other dog away. This way, your insecure dog learns that you can take over the action, protection, and that he can relax.</p>\n<h3>Dog Anxiety On Walk - Defending A Ressource</h3>\n<h4>Ressource Human</h4>\n<p>If your dog thinks that it has unlimited access to you as his human social partner will also want to enforce these requirements when walking on a leash. </p>\n<p>An approaching foreign dog is then kept at a distance by aggressive behaviour. </p>\n<p>In this case, a change in everyday life in parallel with leash training is essential, because this is the only way to change the dog's fundamentally wrong attitude towards you! </p>\n<p>Actually, such behaviour does not really correspond to leash aggression because the dog also shows this behaviour while free-running.</p>\n<p>You should take a step back and see what is going on at home. Do you two play when your dog is in the mood? Do you cuddle when your dog comes to you? Who greets another human first: you or your dog? </p>\n<p>If your dog sets the pace with you, then you might want to reconsider this arrangement. Start by taking another toy as your dog does for the play, initiate cuddle moments, let your dog sit while you greet another human first. </p>\n<h4>Ressource Reproduction</h4>\n<p>In the case of males, aggressive behaviour is often only shown towards uncastrated males. </p>\n<p>If you look at these dogs while they are off-leash, you can see that they are not really relaxed when encountering same-sex dogs either and often react with aggressive behaviour as well. </p>\n<p>Therefore, the aggressive behaviour on the leash due to sexual motivation is actually not a real leash aggression issue.</p>\n<p>A proper obedience training and \"heeling\" work will do the trick here and allow you to walk by without incident.</p>\n<h3>Dog Anxiety On Walk - Methods On How To Walk On The Leash With An Anxious Dog</h3>\n<h4>Method 1: Avoidance</h4>\n<p>While out on your daily walk together, at the sight of another dog just take a detour, go around the other dog putting enough distance between your dog and the other dog, or just turn around in a relaxed manner and walk back like you forgot something at home or in the car. </p>\n<p>If all the above is not possible, try some food as a bribing method. Something that your dog loves above all other treats he gets. </p>\n<h4>Method 2: Carrying A Prize</h4>\n<p>This is the method that works wonders for my dog. He loves the fetch game, so he always carries a ball or a tug toy. That allows him to chew on it when he gets anxious. </p>\n<p>For this, you need to teach your dog in the first place to fetch and then to hold things. </p>\n<p>Fetching is a beautiful way to bond with your dog as well as it will build trust, and you two can have lots of fun. Once you discover the power of fetching and holding, you will become a fan. </p>\n<h4>Method 3: Look</h4>\n<p>Depending on the level of excitement of your dog, you could teach your dog to look at you and hold the eye contact until you pass the other dog.</p>\n<p>You can also use this in combination with sit and stay commands. It is essential to start this kind of training far enough from another dog to enable a positive experience for your dog. </p>\n<h4>Method 4: Touch</h4>\n<p>The touch command is an alternative for the look command, simply because some dogs have issues keeping extended eye contact with humans. </p>\n<h2>My Dog Is Anxious On Walks - Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In the end, it is all about making those mistakes, failing, trying again and failing better. </p>\n<p>There is no perfect recipe, and what works for one dog might not work for another. </p>\n<p>Make sure you get to know your dog and work on that split moment timing when you reinforce the desired behaviour and when not. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postCategory":{"categorySlug":"dog-training","categoryTitle":"Dog Training"},"postDate":"2019-12-29","updatedAt":"2019-12-29","postDescription":{"postDescription":"How do you recognize if your dog is anxious on walks?
