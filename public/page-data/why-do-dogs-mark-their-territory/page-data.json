etc. to other dogs. </p>\n<h2>Different Ways of Marking</h2>\n<p>The dog behaviour literature distinguishes between 4 types of marking: via urine, via faeces, scratching the ground and rubbing the body against an object or a being. </p>\n<h3>Dog Marking With Urine</h3>\n<p>Peeing is the most obvious way we perceive the marking in dogs. As you might have noticed, urinating looks different in female and male dogs. </p>\n<p>During puppyhood, a female dog will crouch deep to relieve herself. At the same time, a male will do a more elevated crouch to relieve himself. </p>\n<p>During puberty, things change, especially for male dogs. Males start lifting the leg, while female dogs continue using the deep crouch for urinating. </p>\n<p>It can also happen that female dogs lift the leg and search for higher places to urinate. This is a sign for marking, and not \"just\" to relieve the bladder. </p>\n<p>Some smaller male dogs with a big personality, like a Terrier, might even do a so-called handstand to mark as high as they can get. </p>\n<p>Males that pee in an elevated crouching position is just plain peeing and not marking. </p>\n<h3>Dog Marking With Poop</h3>\n<p>The way dogs poop is more or less the same from puppyhood to maturity. Some dogs that want to make a territorial statement with their faeces will search for higher ground when pooping and/or even lift a leg.</p>\n<p>Your dog has left, and right, one to two centimetres from the anus entrance, two pea-sized anal glands that produce a strong smelly secretion.</p>\n<p>This secretion bears the very distinct smell of your dog and is released in small quantities every time your dog takes a poop. </p>\n<p>In extreme cases, if a dog is exposed to massive panic or fear, the glands can suddenly empty as well. </p>\n<h3>Dog Marking By Scratching The Ground</h3>\n<p>Some dogs will scratch the ground after they marked the spot via urine or faeces. This behaviour is mainly shown only when other dogs or humans are present. </p>\n<p>By scratching the ground and assuming an imposing posture, the dog wants to highlight to his audience, that he marked that spot, in case someone missed the marking with urine or faeces. </p>\n<p>The soil that is lifted fills with his scent, and also, will get the smell from the sweat glands on the dog's paw pads.</p>\n<h3>Dog Marking By Rubbing Against Objects And / Or Humans</h3>\n<p>Another form of marking is rubbing against a person or object. The dog walks close to the person or object and rubs its fur against it. </p>\n<p>As a result, it leaves its smell on the object or person, making his ownership claim clear to everybody watching or later on sniffing. </p>\n<h2>Why Do Dogs Mark?</h2>\n<p>Dogs have several reasons why they mark and leave their scent, thus their information, behind.</p>\n<h3>Territorial Marking</h3>\n<p>Territorial marking can help a dog \"remember\" his way around the neighbourhood. Still, it is also a clear statement to other dogs that this is his territory.</p>\n<p>Certain parts of paths, particular passages, borders and other important places are marked so that the dog can recognise and get a better orientation. </p>\n<p>Some dogs are more territorial than others. </p>\n<p>If you see your dog making and his body language tells a story of \"you saw nothing\" can be because he has a low territorial claim. </p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, your dog comes after marking with high chest and his body language shows obviously a particular pride of his deed, then your dog has a high territorial claim. </p>\n<p>Do you have a dog that search for it feels to you an eternity to do his business? </p>\n<p>Well, this has a reason too. He is either a very picky dog and searches precisely the spot where he can overmark, or he does not want under any circumstances to mark where other dogs marked. </p>\n<img src=\"/images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5UiqJw4UWtVdiLxLjhizGL/5fbb32a24338b23e343090aa2c45eceb/_MG_0517.jpeg\" alt=\"Why Do Dogs Mark Their Territory\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h3>Relationship and Ownership</h3>\n<p>Two dogs that know each other very good or are even living in the same house can resolve to a behaviour called overmarking. </p>\n<p>Overmarking means that a dog will mark on the exact spot the other dog marked. It is intended as a signal that will reinforce the sense of belonging together, thus showing other dogs the relationship the two dogs are in. </p>\n<p>As described above, dogs will also mark their humans to make clear to other dogs who the human \"belongs\" to. </p>\n<h2>What To Do When Your Dog Is Marking On A Walk?</h2>\n<p> First of all, you have to allow your dog to relieve himself shortly after going out. </p>\n<p>This does not necessarily have to be done in the first few meters, but relatively at the beginning of the walk. </p>\n<p>After that, you should not constantly stop and wait until your dog has marked all the critical points, but continue on your way. It is not the dog that is responsible for securing the territory, but you are.</p>\n<p>Off leash, there is no point in forbidding the dog from marking by scolding him.  The advice to urinate yourself on top of your dog's marking is nonsense as well. Both would only show the dog that you lack confidence because you act up about him marking, which by the way is just a natural communication way for dogs. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postCategory":{"categorySlug":"dog-care","categoryTitle":"Dog Care"},"postDate":"2020-01-08","updatedAt":"2020-01-12","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Marking in dogs is like facebook for humans.
