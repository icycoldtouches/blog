Sometimes you see the signals and know precisely what is going on, and sometimes you wonder what just happened.\n\n**If the dog looks over the bridge of the nose held down, the situation is serious. He is now seriously prepared to face a conflict.**\n\nThis means for the dog owner to pay attention and de-escalate the situation. You can do that by turning around and calling your dog, i.e. putting distance between your dog and whatever made him get serious.\n\n**If the dog looks up at someone and the bridge of your nose stays up, it is a sign of insecurity.**\n\nThe eye contact with the other dog should be interrupted so that the uncertainty of the dog is not increased. \n\nIf eye contact is maintained too long, sensitive dogs, in particular, could feel threatened. \n\nOn the one hand, this can lead to the dog feeling so cornered that it starts an attack. On the other hand, it can also lead to the dog losing confidence, feeling more and more insecure.\n\n## Aggressive Dog Body Language\n\n* The dog is looking at someone with a lowered nose bridge.\n* Ears are up and forward\n* The dog is making himself look bigger\n* His tail is high and rigid\n* The hackles are up\n* His body weight is forward and ready to lunge\n* He will be staring directly at his opponent\n* Teeth are exposed by a vertically top raised lip, and the nose is wrinkled\n* The dog might be growling, snarling or low pitched barking\n\n## Signs A Dog Is Scared - Fearful Dog Body Language\n\n* The dog is looking at someone with high held nose bridge.\n* The eyes are wide and rounded, and you can see the white part of the eyeball. A fearful dog will most likely look away from you or the other dog. \n* The dog leans his weight on the slightly lowered hind legs, with the shoulder area somewhat lowered and the head stretched forward. This weight distribution makes the dog look smaller and allows it to escape more quickly.\n* The more insecure or submissive a dog is, the more it bends his back and makes a kind of hump.\n* When a dog raises his hackles is a sign of insecurity or excitement. \n* If you meet an insecure dog, you should not seek direct eye contact. In prolonged eye contact, he recognises a threat and would become even more insecure. He can lash out, bark, jump even bite if the dog feels cornered. \n\n## Sign Of A Confident Dog\n\n* The self-confident dog shifts his weight to the straight front legs. Thereby he holds his head straight up and in the direction of his interest and lowers the muzzle slightly. The tail is carried horizontally, at most slightly raised, the back is straight.#\n* If the dog is self-confident, impresses or threatens, it keeps its back all the more straight and pushes its limbs stiffly through.\n\n\n## Dog Posture Meaning\n\nBy learning and observing your dog, you will see that he is continuously telling you exactly how he feels and what his intentions are. \nYou just have to know what to look for and be able to interpret it.\n\nBy learning your dog's posture, meaning and language, you will be able to notice little signs of stress, anger or confusion when they occur.  You can now adjust your behaviour (and other's) to trigger aggression or any distress caused to your dog.\n\nA bond with your dog is a two-way relationship, based on trust, love, respect and two-way communication and understanding. \n\nYour dog is continuously watching and learning all he can about you, adjusting his behaviour at times to suit what he sees. It's only fair that you do the same towards him.\n\nTrust, respect, love & communication. \n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team\n"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-12-06T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

It is a slow way to move forward. A younger or adult dog uses walking pace only for a short period of times. Mostly it is used by elderly or sick dogs.\n\n\n## Stalking\n\n\nStalking is shown by a dog either shortly before he attacks or lunges after the prey. It can be part of playtime as well. \n\n\nThe dog will lower his head to be in line with his back, focuses and stalks his opponent. This action is followed by either a fake attack or a heavy body contact play. \n\n\n## Trotting\n\n\nIt is the most preferred way of moving forward for a healthy adult dog. \n\n\nThe diagonal legs (front and back) will lift from the ground at the same time. In between the dog floats above the ground. \n\n\n### Side Trotting\n\n\nThe legs on the same side will be lifted at the same time from the ground. \n\n\nThis way of trotting is used by dogs:\n* that are very tired, since it is a very energy-saving way of moving\n* that have issues with their back or their gate\n\n\nSometimes dogs use this type of movement because their human is to fast for their walking pace, but too slow for their regular trotting. Used if the dog has to walk for an extended period on the leash with their human. \n\n\n### Imposing Trotting\n\nAn elegant looking trot used to impose on other dogs or humans. \n\nFeatures of imposing trotting:\n\n* The steps the dog takes are bouncy\n* his body is raised, chest broadened\n* his tail is raised up high\n* his ears are forward towards the person or dog he is imposing on\n\n## Gallop\n\nThis is the fastest way a dog can move. We distinguish between an imposing gallop and a chasing gallop. \n\n### Imposing Gallop\n\nThe imposing gallop is used by the dog in a fake attack while playing. The dog looks like he is hopping like a bunny towards his play partner.  \n\nFeatures of the imposing gallop:\n* his back is straight\n* his tail is up high\n* he is pounding the ground with his front legs\n\n### Chasing gallop\n\nThe dog uses this type of movement when he is chasing after prey. This is the fastest way a dog can move forward. \n\nFeatures of chasing gallop:\n* front legs stretch far to the front, the hind legs will firmly push into the ground to send the dog as far forward as possible\n* the tail is raised on the same hight as the back\n* the head is also held at the same hight as the back\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-11-22T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

It indicates thereby, first of all, only excitement. This excitement can be of joyful nature, but also a threatening gesture.\n\nIf you are aware of the many meanings of the tail wagging, you will also understand the difficulty in communicating a tail docked dog has. It is hardly possible for him to communicate with his stunted tail tip. \n\nFurthermore, such dogs are often misunderstood by other dogs without being aware of the problem themselves. To the other dog, it looks as if the dog is retracting its tail, even if he is threatening, for example.\n\n## Tail Wagging - Quick Tail Wagging \n\nFast wagging is a sign of excitement or tension. The quicker the dog is wagging his tail, the higher his state of excitement. \n\n\nA dog with a long tail will wag more widely and more slowly. A dog with a short tail, on the other hand, will move back and forth very quickly and briefly, almost even vibrate. \n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Slow Tail Wagging With The Tip Of the Tail\n\n\nThe dog shows this type of tail wagging as a reaction to attention he is given or the return of his family members. \n\n\nIt can also express a friendly and appeasing mood towards the higher ranking dog. Puppies show this waving almost exclusively when greeting their parents.\n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Vibrating Tail Wagging With The Tip Of the Tail\n\n\nThe dog shows this type of tail wagging when he meets a competitor. The two dogs circle around each other and assess the strength and intentions of the other.\n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Swinging Tail Wagging\n\n\nWhen a dog shows a swinging tail wagging, the tail swings slightly side to side. Thereby the head is somewhat lowered, and the dog stares at the opposite person or dog. This behaviour is a threatening one. The dog threatens the opponent to start an attack if he comes towards him now.\n\n\n## Tail Wagging - One-Sided Tail Wagging\n\n\nThe dog can also wag strongly to one side only. This behaviour can be seen, for example, when a dog stands next to a human. \n\n\nIf the dog increasingly waves in the direction of the human. The human is perfumed with the scent of the dog, so to say the dog is marking his human.\n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Wide Tail Wagging\n\n\nThe broad waving is not threatening but friendly and is a sign that the dog is doing well. It is often shown during the play, where it is supported by growling and barking. The sounds are not a sign of relaxation, though. \n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Wide In Form Of 8 Tail Wagging\n\n\nThe dog shows the broad tail wagging in the shape of an eight only at the most vigorous excitement! This wagging can be seen, for example, when a sexually active male dog meets a lady. \n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Wide Tail Wagging With Hip Movement\n\n\nThe dog shows this very friendly tail wagging when he greets another friendly dog or his family. The more the dog lowers its backside, the more excited it is. This submissive wagging is often supported by hectic licking or licking into the air. The dog’s head is lowered and slightly turned to the side.\n\n\n## Tail Wagging - Slow Tail Wagging With Lowered Tail\n\n\nAs long as the tail is neither high nor low, but slightly lowered, the dog shows insecurity about the situation or uncertainty about his own actions. As soon as the uncertainty subsides or increases strongly, he will raise or lower his tail again.\n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Showing Downwards\n\n\nA dog with a loose, downward hanging tail gives a signal for calmness and relaxation. The dog stands loose and relaxed with its weight on all four paws, its attention is not directed in any particular direction.\n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Is Loosely Parallel To The Ground Without Movement\n\n\nThe dog shows attention. This is the position he shows, for example, when a person approaches or when he hears a sound that attracts his attention. Both the arrival of the person and the sound are not considered threatening by him.\n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Is Rigidly Parallel To The Ground Without Movement\n\n\nThe rigid tail indicates increased alert and/or aggression, e.g. when foreign dogs approach. Even in competitive situations, dogs signal their mood until the situation is resolved.\n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Is Upright Slightly Curved Over The Back\n\n\nThis dog shows imposing behaviour, which is expressed by the tail being curved or bent over his back. A dog shows this posture, for example, when it meets a competitor. He does not want to embarrass himself in front of the other dog. Still, he does not yet assess the situation as seriously threatening.\n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Is Completely Curved Over The Back\n\n\nThis dog does not expect any threat, on the contrary, he is self-confident. \n\n\nThe tail completely curved over the back can be a sign of absolute social security. Some dogs often enough overplay their insecurity in a particular situation by pretending a strong presence. \n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Is Completely Lowered And Somewhat Pinched Between The Legs\n\n\nIf the hind legs are stretched, this position signals psychological stress, pain or illness. \n\n\nIf the hind legs are bent, and the hips are lowered, this position signals that the dog is insecure, shows fear or worry. \n\n\n## Tail Position - Tail Is Completely Pinched Between The Legs\n\n\nThe deeper the dog holds the tail and the more he clamps it between his hind legs, the more uncertain he is. \n\n\nThis position is taken by dogs that want to show as less presence as possible to make it clear to the other dog that they do not wish to provoke them.\n\n\nThis posture is also an essential signal for appeasement.\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-11-08T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

Language","postSlug":"dog-posture-meaning-dog-body-language","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"\nHow a dog positions his body and what type of body positions he adopts is also paramount for the communication towards us humans as well as towards other dogs.\n\n## The T-Position Dog Body Language \n\nThe T-position is an active territorial limitation of the opposite dog, where one dog stands in the way of the other, crossing his path so to speak. \n\nTwo dogs meet each other, sniff each other, turn in circles until one, more active dog overtakes the other and stands dominantly crosswise in front of him. \n\nIn such situations, dog owners should leave in opposite directions quickly but not hectically, to de-escalate the situation. \n\nIf the other dog does not accept the dominant position of the first dog, he can show this by ignorance and pass the rear of the first dog. \n\nIf the oppressed dog shows himself submissive towards the dominant one, e.g. by turning its head or even its whole body away, the situation can also relax, as this has been clarified first.\n\n## Relaxed Dog Body Language \n\nTo understand all the different meanings of your dog’s body language, you first have to recognise and understand what your dog looks like in a relaxed state. \n\nThese are the features of a relaxed dog:\n* he stands on his all four paws with slightly bent hind legs\n* his head is slightly raised\n* his muzzle is somewhat open, and you can see a little bit of his tongue\n* his tail is lowered and relaxed\n* his ears are positioned slightly to the front side of his head\n\n## Alert Dog Body Language \n\nThese are the features of an alert dog:\n* his head is raised and somewhat tilted forward\n* his weight is slightly shifted forward\n* his ears are turned forward\n* his eyes are open and attentive\n* his muzzle is closed \n* his tail is relatively parallel to the ground and moves side to side\n\n## Playful Dog Body Language \n\nThese are the features of a playful dog:\n\n* typical gesture for playfulness is the lowered front part of the body, where the front legs almost completely touch the ground\n* his tail is broadly moving and is held up high\n* his ears are up and to the front\n* his eyes are wide open\n* his muzzle is open, and his tongue is well visible\n* your dog can let out a high pitched bark to round the entire invitation to play up\n* during play the dog will change body postures quickly\n\n## Imposing Dog Body Language \n\nThere are several ways a dog is imposing: \n* marking\n* humping\n* putting his paws on top of the other dog/human\n* t-positioning\n\nBut in addition to the features mentioned above, a dog can also use the following body language to impose:\n* he is standing stiff on his all four legs\n* he is raising his head and pushing his chest forward and up as well with the intention to make himself look bigger\n* his tail is up, wagging slowly from one side to the other\n* his ears show forward\n* his eyes might be averting from his opponent since imposing doesn’t always have to be of an aggressive nature\n\n## Offensive Threatening Dog Body Language \n\nThe attitude in the offensive threat is similar to the imposing body posture.\n\nThese are the features of an offensive threatening dog:\n* the dog stands stiff-legged and slightly tilted forward\n* his head is slightly lowered, so that head and back form a line\n* the facial expression is characterised by short, rounded mouth angles, which are raised towards the front\n* the ears are directed forward, and the opponent is possibly also fixed growling\n* his neck whithers are raised\n* his tail is raised above the backline, the tail hairs may also be raised\n* the tail is stiff, but it can also vibrate slightly\n* shortly before an attack, a snarling may occur\n\nThe more insecure the dog is in this situation, the longer the mouth angles are pulled backwards. \n\n## Defensive Threatening Dog Body Language \n\nAnother dog can respond to an offensive threat with a defensive threat. \nThese are the features of a defensive threatening dog:\n* the dog’s hind legs are slightly bent, aiming for a shrinking of the body\n* his tail is lowered and pinched between his hind legs\n* he is putting the ears back\n* the corners of the mouth are pulled back long and pointed\n* the teeth are bared over the entire mouth area, that much that the molars and gums are also visible\n* he is biting in the air\n* the dog can even scream, growl or bark.\n\n## Submissive Dog Body Language \n\nSubmission is when a lower-ranking animal submits to a higher ranking one. \n\nThese are the features of a submissive dog:\n* the dog is making himself smaller\n* he is lowering his head to the ground, beginning to crawl or lying on its back\n\nThis behaviour can dampen the aggression of other dogs, as the reduced, infantile body posture of the dog makes the other dog understand that no danger emanates from him. \n\nHowever, the opponent may also feel so disturbed by the mere presence of the other dog that submissive behaviour is not sufficient to stop the aggression.\n\n### Active Submissive Dog Body Language \n\nThe active submission starts from the submissive animal itself. \n\nThe lower-ranking dog is also tense, but approaches the higher ranking dog and tries to calm him down actively by licking the corners of his mouth or lifting his paw to calm him down. \n\nEye contact is not avoided - as in passive submission - but short and indirect eye contacts are made. The dog reduces his height. \n\n### Passive Submissive Dog Body Language \n\nIn this case, the other dog submits completely, lies on its back and does not dare to move in the slightest. \n\nThe dog in this position behaves completely calm, quiet and passive.\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-10-25T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

Under his lips, he has a powerful jaw with different types of teeth. \n\nThe dark colour of his lips is in contrast with not only his fur but also his teeth and dark colour of the inside of his mouth.\n\nAs a warning and precursor of intense aggression, the dog pulls his lips up, in the process, he may growl and frown. Matching the facial expressions, the body language is, of course, also under tension.\n\n* If a dog is insecure and submissive, he will only pull his mouth backwards and shows its teeth only when the insecurity is coupled with aggressiveness.\n* \n* If a dog feels sure about his actions, the mouth is drawn forward. Also, here the dog shows its teeth additionally only if aggression is involved. Here, however, the showing of teeth also refers only to the front incisors and canines.\n\n## Why Do Dogs Lick Their Lips?\n\nLet’s start with the natural, obvious answer: your dog sniffed out the chicken, and since he likes it, he will lick his lips to signalise that. \n\nThe more hidden meaning of lips licking is that the dog is showing you he is stressed. This behaviour is also accompanied by a submissive body posture. \n\n## Why Do Dogs Yawn?\n\nThe natural answer is he might be sleepy, or he just woke up — a sign of being tired. \n\nThe more subtle meaning is that your dog is releasing tension after coming out from a stressed or confusing situation.\n\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-10-11T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

They are almost fixated on things that move. \n\nIn a dense blanket of leaves in the forest, your dog does not perceive each leaf as we do. For him, the whole thing actually seems more like a surface. But he registers every little movement within this surface.\n\n\nThe fact that a dog is so strongly fixated on movement tells me that in training, it is always necessary to work with body language signals such as hand signals. \n\n\nThe dog has a much wider field of vision than humans: 270° compared to 200° in humans. Therefore dogs can detect the slightest movement in an extensive area. \n\n\nDogs are worse at estimating distances correctly. This is related to the overlap degree between the individual fields of vision: 60° for dogs and 120° for humans. Humans can also switch better between near and far vision than dogs, thanks to having a bigger lens build in. :-)\n\n\nA dog is not on the same eye level as a human being. This means that dogs, due to their lower body height, cannot see their surroundings as well as we humans can. \n\n\nThe person behind the hedge can only be seen by the dog after he has passed the hedge. You, as the person walking with your dog, should be aware of such situations. In such sudden encounters, the dog can get scared, frightened and/or react aggressively.\n\n\nWith their eyes, dogs can indicate almost all moods. They are an essential part of facial expressions. \n\n\nA dog’s gaze can be stiff, rigid, threatening, warm, demanding, fixating or fearful, to name just a few examples. The eyes can change size becoming bigger or smaller. Besides, each dog has a very individual eye shape, so there are dogs with round and dogs with almond-shaped eyes.\n\n\n## Dog Eye Language - Dog Facial Expressions\n\n\n* If a dog is in an aggressive mood, it pulls the eyebrow region together, downwards against the bridge of the nose. \n* If a dog is frightened or submissive, it pulls it upwards against the temples.\n* If a dog sees something exciting or frightening, his pupils dilate. Same also happens if a dog is happy. \n* If a dog is tired or sleepy, then his pupils will get smaller.\n* If a dog directs his gaze directly and for a long time at another dog, this is to be understood as a sign of provocation or threat.\n* Submissiveness, restraint, peace seeker are signalled with an averted gaze, which can also be supported by blinking.\n* For the subordinate members of the pack, it is essential to continually observe higher ranking animals to check out their mood. This attentive look is only of short duration.\n* A gaze that lasts longer than two seconds can be dominant or a sign of a self-assured threat, This action is also backed up by threatening signals displayed by the rest of the body.\n* If a dog stares at a human being, he sometimes does so only out of pure interest, out of joy, out of anxious expectation, because we might just be telling him something. Look at the big picture and context of the situation.\n\n## Dog Posture Meaning - Dog Forehead Body Language\n\n\n* Frowning is a signal of aggression or insecurity. Please notice the rest of your dog’s body language. See the context, see the big picture. \n* If a dog shows submissiveness, it pulls its forehead very smoothly with its ears backwards, the eyes appear large and round, the ears are laid back.\n\n\n## What Colours Can Dogs See?\n\nSince dogs and their ancestors are most active at dawn and dusk, e.g. in search of prey, the eye performance of day-active humans differs considerably from theirs. \n\nThe cones inside our eyes are responsible for the colour vision. Humans have three different cone types for the colours red, green and blue. The brain then forms the overall colour impression of the colour information from the cones. \n\nDogs, however, only have two different types of cones, they lack cones for the colour red. Therefore the dog cannot recognise the colour red. \n\nThe dog’s colour vision is therefore roughly comparable to that of a person with red-green blindness. This information should be explicitly used in training. \n\nFor example, if the dog is to use its nose when it is supposed to look for a ball in a meadow, it makes sense to choose a red ball. The dog can hardly make out this ball in the green field with his eyes. \n\nIf, however, your dog needs to find the ball quickly, it is better to choose a blue ball, as he can immediately perceive it as a blue point in the green field.\n\n## Can Dogs See In The Dark?\n\nDogs have a light-reflecting layer on the back of their eyes, called *tapetum lucidum*. Because of the reflection, the light falls a second time on the cones inside the dog’s eyes, which is why he can see better in the dark than humans.\n\nIn principle, the dog’s eyes do not function significantly different from those of humans. Light enters through the pupil and is directed by the lens onto the retina. The retina transmits commands to the brain via the optical nerve. \n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-09-27T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

He uses the different positions of eyes, ears, lips, forehead and head to communicate.\n\n\nCompared to body language, facial expressions change much faster. Therefore it is also more challenging to interpret the facial expressions of a dog. A small, short glance in another direction can mean a lot. Dogs would never overlook these signals.\n\n\nVisual communication, in particular, plays a vital role in initial contact because the first impression often determines the further course of an encounter. And even if the tactile signals are usually only used at the very end, i.e. after the dogs have perceived each other visually, olfactory and possibly also auditory, they are still of great importance in dog language.\n\n\nBreed diversity plays a significant role in facial communication. If my German shepherd mix is showing his teeth, every other breed can see it and recognise this. If a Bobtail does it, it is almost not visible due to his long facial and muzzle hairs. On the other side is the Mops that seems to be showing teeth 24/7. \n\n\nDogs must, therefore, learn about the different breeds and their expressions already in the puppyhood. \n\n\n## How Do Dogs Communicate With Humans\n\n\nIt is essential that people know and recognise the sometimes minimal visual signals of dogs and that they know which tactile stimuli dogs like or dislike.\n\n\nRead this blog to learn how your dog is communicating with you and with other humans and dogs.\n\n\n## How Do Dogs Communicate With Each Other\n\n\nIf two dogs do not get along with each other, it is quickly decided whether an aggressive physical confrontation can no longer be avoided. \n\n\nIf two dogs meet and like each other, after the first exchange of visual, olfactory or auditory signals, a wild, body-accentuated game may begin.

When and where does your dog bark?\n2. Who or what is the target of your dog's bark?\n3. What triggers your dog's barking? Objects, sounds, animals, people, etc. \n4. Why is your dog barking?\n\n\nI also noticed many people frequently ask questions about **why dogs bark**, for example:\n\n\n* Why do dogs bark at night?\n* Why do dogs bark at other dogs?\n* Why do dogs bark at certain people?\n* Why do dogs bark at the door?\n\n\nRead on to find out more about the reasons mentioned above and to answer your questions about why dogs bark. \n\n\n## Territorial Barking\n\n\nYour dog's territory is not limited to your home, car and garden. It extends to the places where your dogs spend a lot of time. So for example, if you walk daily to the nearby park, at some extent your dog considers the parts of the park to be his territory.  \n\n\nYour dog can start barking excessively at people, animals, another dog especially, that enter or get close to his territory. \n\n\nIf your dog lives in a big yard, he can fall into the patrolling behaviour barking at anything and everything that approaches his yard. \n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n\n* Prevent your dog from taking the patrolling officer behaviour.\n* If you have a large garden, there is no need for your dog to have access everywhere, thus limit his territory. \n* Don't allow your dog to say hi to people at the front door, at the front gate or through the fence.\n* Teach the command \"quiet\". This is not as simple as this sentence, but nonetheless super effective if you teach it to your dog. \n\n\n## Alarm Barking\n\n\nThe alarm barking can be abrupt and startling, and it takes place when your dog senses a threat in the vicinity of your/his home/area.\n\n\nIgnoring the alarm barking may lead to persistent and continuous barking, as your dog is trying to inform you about the situation, but no one is listening. \n\n\nFurthermore, alarm barking might change to territorial barking. If you are not reacting to the alarm bark, then your dog might take on the assignment to protect the home. \n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n\n* Don't ignore your dog's bark. \n* Say thank you and go check it out. Be assertive and in control. That shows your dog you are in control of the situation and he doesn't need to start his defence protocols. \n* Teach the command \"quiet\". This is not as simple as this sentence, but nonetheless super effective if you teach it to your dog. \n* Teach your dog to \"go on his spot\". Very useful if someone is actually at the door. Like a mailman or neighbour.\n\n\n## Attention-Seeking Barking\n\n\nMost dogs crave attention. Here is an example of attention barking behaviour.\n\n\nImagine you work on your computer or watch TV, and you ignore your dog. A dog that doesn't have a balanced life (play, attention, cuddle, food, water, workout, walks) will seek your attention to fulfil whatever he is still in need for. \n\n\nSome forms of attention-seeking are: \n\n* your dog brings you his toy and sits near you with it or puts it in your lap\n* your dog is pawing you\n* your dog is pushing you with his nose\n* your dog is licking you\n* your dog is running around you\n\n\nIf the above mentioned quiet behaviours are ignored, your dog will bark.\nAs soon as you gave your dog attention when he barked, your dog will memorise that bark = attention.  \n\n\nYour smart dog has found *the* way to distract you from whatever you are doing. Any form of attention you give him at that point is a reinforcement for attention-seeking, even negative attention, is a reward.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n\n* Don't reward your dog for barking at you in this situation.\n* Make sure your dog's needs are met. Workout, training, mind training as well.\n* Regularly seek your dog and give him attention, not when he is annoying for, but when he is in a calm state. \n\n\n## Greeting Barking\n\n\nThis is a joyful bark accompanied by whining, tail wagging and other signs of friendliness. Your dog most likely barks the same way when family members come home as well. \n\n\nOverdoing it can lead to having a dog that jumps on family members, on you, on visitors. \n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n\n* Keep greetings low key. Explain to your visit and ask them to stay calm and ignore your dog. Nothing is worse in this situation than an auntie with high pitched voice and baby talk running to your dog for kisses. \n* Teach your dog to hold his toy before you let visit in. Not going to work in some dogs, since the excitement over the people is higher than the toy. \n* Teach your dog to ignore walkers, bikers, joggers, cars, etc. When someone wants to pass, call you dog to heel and pass the person calmly. Honestly, I love dog dogs, but I find it unnecessary for any dog to come and jump on me. Also, keep in mind some people are afraid of dogs. \n* Change your doorbell ring tone. As silly as it sounds, your dog gets conditioned, and that sounds = excitement. Try another ring tone and give the new tone another meaning, e.g. new doorbell sound = yummy chicken. \n\n\n## Compulsive Barking\n\n\nCompulsive barking is a repetitive barking held over a long period. If you observe your dog, you will notice that he is not alarmed, but shows repeated behaviours like spinning, circling or jumping while barking. \n\n\nThe barking is focused towards well apparently nothing and everything from staring at the sky, fence or mirror to lights, shadows or doors. \n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n\n* Find the source and never leave it for too long because it will only become harder to undo the behaviour.\n* Go for a check-up at the vet to rule out any physiological issues.\n* Be patient and do not yell at your dog. It will only agitate your dog even more, and his barking becomes now justified. \n* Divert his attention either with games, training (nothing too complicated) or go for a walk or run. \n* Seek help from a dog behaviourist. Note that not every dog trainer is suited for your dog's issue. \n\n\n## Socially Facilitated Barking\n\n\nSometimes your dog barks just because of other dogs barking. This is not every dog. Please remember every dog is unique in their likes and dislikes. \n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n\n* Keep your dog indoors. \n* Turn the music or tv on.\n* Turn your dog's attention from another dog on you for play and training. \n\n\n## Frustration-Induced Barking\n\n\nDid your dog ever pushed his toy in a corner or under the sofa and he was not able to get it? Did he bark? I know Thor does. He would look under the couch where his ball rolled and bark at it. \n\n\nAnother example is I try to set up games for Thor that make him think. So I showed him his ball and put it into a huge carton box. After a couple of seconds that he wasn't able to get it, he started barking out of frustration.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n\n* Teach your dog patience. Best way to do it is to attend obedience classes that will help him control his impulses. \n* Discourage excitement and make your dog wait before going on, getting his favourite toy or his dinner. \n\n\n## Illness or Injury\n\n\nA senior dog may bark in a repetitive, monotonous manner, for no particular reason. \n\n\nA dog with dementia will get lost in familiar places, may not recognise their owner, or fail to follow basic, previously known, commands. \n\n\nThis situation is frightening for the dog, and he might be barking because he is confused. \n\n\nYour dog can also bark if he has an injury and something or someone touches that tender spot.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n\n* Consult your vet immediately. \n* Get to terms with the fact that your dog is old. Old is not bad, it is just a state. Be in the moment. \n\n\n## Boredom Barking\n\n\nThe word boredom says it all: your dog is bored and he chooses to bark as an outlet. Is like with some humans that go for the chips bag ( guilty as charged here :-)).\n\n\nIt is similar to the attention-seeking bark, but most of the times this occurs when your dog is left alone at home. \n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n\n* Play regularly with your dog mind stimulating games, e.g. the search for food or toys. \n* Train and workout regularly. \n\n\n## Separation-Anxiety Barking\n\n\nThis condition sets your dog in a high state of stress which leads to destructive behaviour and excessive barking, putting you at the bottom on your neighbour's Like List. \n\n\nSome dogs enter a state of panic and seek to be reunited with the owner.\n\n\nCharacteristic behaviour:\n* Scratching and chewing at the windows and doors\n* Urination and defecation\n* Pacing, lack of calmness \n* Excessive drooling\n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n\n* Play regularly with your dog mind stimulating games, e.g. the search for food or toys. \n* Train and workout regularly. \n* Refrain from saying goodbye when you leave the house.\n* Most dog's need to smell their owner's scent, so place a sweated shirt wherever your dog sleeps. My dog spends his 5h alone at home in our bed. Now I know this is not for everybody, but this is ok for us and works fine for him. \n* Seek help from a dog behaviourist. Note that not every dog trainer is suited for your dog's issue. Some dog owners just give up and give their dog up for adoption, but separation anxiety can be worked on. No need to bail out. \n\n\n## Fearful Barking\n\n\nMost people confuse (especially if it is a bigger dog breed) this type of barking with aggressive dog behaviour. \n\n\nCharacteristic behaviour:\n* Flattened ears\n* Corner of the mouth pulled back\n* Whites of the eyes showing\n* Hackles and/or tail might be up. \n* Nervous pacing\n\n\nThe fearful barking is used as a distance-increasing signal, and it is high pitched and repetitive. Your dog wants for the trigger to go away. \n\n\nWhen your dog is fearful and barking, he may run back and forth, and if he is on the leash, maybe he will be zig-zagging. \n\n\nFear barking may be triggered by sights (dog sees another dog or jogger), sounds (dog hears the sound of the dog tags of another dog), and even smells. Sudden movements of a person or prolonged eye contact from a stranger can be the cause of a sudden plunge forward and barking. \n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n\n* See the context and identify the trigger. Work on desensitisation and reconditioning. \n* Give your dog the space he needs, do not force him into situations you know he will fail. Set him up for success. \n* Train obedience.\n* Learn your dog's behaviour and prevent outbursts. \n\t\t* Notice what strangers do, e.g. in case of a prolonged eye contact turn around with your dog and walk a couple of meters in the same direction. That will break the staring contest, and you shift your dog's attention on you.\n\t\t* Increase the distance to another dog if that is his trigger. Turn around, go on the other sidewalk. I know it is frustrating, but it will get better with time and training. \n* Pay attention to your environment. Try to spot the trigger before your dog does. \n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nWhere you able to answer the 4 key questions?\n\n\n1. When and where does your dog bark?\n2. Who or what is the target of your dog's bark?\n3. What triggers your dog's barking? Objects, sounds, animals, people, etc. \n4. Why is your dog barking?\n\n\nA couple of tips before you go:\n\n\n* Look at the context and trust your gut. YOU know your dog. Pay attention to him and seek professional help. Please assess how professional this help is beforehand. I went through painfully 5 dog trainers. Made a million mistakes and worked hard with my dog for 2 years to correct them. \n* Experiment and try new ways to see if they work for you and your dog. \n* Educate yourself about dog behaviour. Do not expect others to fix your dog. \n* Use positive reinforcement. \n* Do you REALLY have a problem? Do you see people yelling at their horses for whining, or their cats for meowing, or their cow for mooing? Dog bark. Is it excessive, or is it just healthy communication?\n\n\n\n## Why Do Dogs Bark - FAQ \n\n\n### Why Do Dogs Bark At Other Dogs?\n\n\nHonestly, I can not say exactly, because it is all about context and body language. If I am not there to see, I can not tell. \n\n\nReasons could be:\n* to say hello\n* to tell the other dog to go away \n* guarding the owner \n* guarding/warning other pack members\n\n\n## Why Do Dogs Bark At Strangers\n\n\nSome dog trainers, blogs, etc. say that if your dog is socialised enough, he will be happy among all people no matter who they are and what they are doing. \n\n\nMy opinion: bullshit. There I cursed, and I am not going to delete it. \n\n\nLet me ask you: do you like everyone you have ever met and will like everyone you will ever meet? I would say no. I don’t say you hate people, I just say you will not go for coffee with everybody you have ever met or will ever meet. \n\n\nYou have your preferences, and so does your dog. Sure, your dog can be unfamiliar with Eskimos (nothing against them, just the first distinctive people that occurred to me). That means nothing, though. Your dog is not a racist. He will prefer some people over others, regardless of their colour and where they come from. \n\n\nIf your dog doesn’t like someone, again context is vital, then he will say so. You see, they are honest like that. \n\n\n## Nervous Dog Barking At Visitors\n\n\nRe-read the section about greeting barking. At the end of the day, dogs are animals. They have their territories, and they ring the alarm. It is what happens after the alarm is given is important, and how you behave when the alarm goes. Calm and assertive are key here.\n\n\n## Why Do Dogs Bark At Night\n\n\nWhere do you live? \n\n\nDo you live in a flat, that is quiet after 10pm and any noise in the middle of the night is considered unusual? My dog barked because someone was trying to steal my bike, so thanks to him, I still have it :-).\n\n\nDo you live in a place where nocturnal animals come out and are active? Your dog smells them from miles away, so he is ringing the alarm / being territorial. \n\n## Why Do Dogs Bark - The Things You Don’t Do\n\n* Don’t put a shock collar on your dog\n* Don’t spray your dog in the nose with lemon \n* Don’t yell at your dog\n* Don’t hit your dog\n* Don’t lock your dog up in the kennel or a room or outside\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-07-28T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Barking, whining, whimpering, yelping, howling and growling, is a dog's natural means of communication.\n\nA dog may bark for several reasons: \n\n- To discipline puppies\n- To induce play/excitement\n- Out of boredom/loneliness\n- When he is scared\n- To warn of danger/guarding\n- To threaten intruders"},"postFeaturedImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4988290398126465,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2jUxVDTxXci2M4L6ChIkp8/63be67b3abbd260004179837cac2b8ab/_MG_0841.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2jUxVDTxXci2M4L6ChIkp8/63be67b3abbd260004179837cac2b8ab/_MG_0841.jpeg?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2jUxVDTxXci2M4L6ChIkp8/63be67b3abbd260004179837cac2b8ab/_MG_0841.jpeg?w=400&h=267&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2jUxVDTxXci2M4L6ChIkp8/63be67b3abbd260004179837cac2b8ab/_MG_0841.jpeg?w=800&h=534&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2jUxVDTxXci2M4L6ChIkp8/63be67b3abbd260004179837cac2b8ab/_MG_0841.jpeg?w=1200&h=801&q=50 1200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2jUxVDTxXci2M4L6ChIkp8/63be67b3abbd260004179837cac2b8ab/_MG_0841.jpeg?w=1280&h=854&q=50 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"updatedAt":"2020-08-27T16:42:15.663Z"}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["4202924991"]}
