Territory?","postSlug":"why-do-dogs-mark-their-territory","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"# What is Marking? \n\nThe pee, as well as the poop of a dog, contain so-called pheromones that will pass information like age, health, sex, etc. to other dogs. \n\n\n## Different Ways of Marking\n\nThe dog behaviour literature distinguishes between 4 types of marking: via urine, via faeces, scratching the ground and rubbing the body against an object or a being. \n\n### Dog Marking With Urine\n\nPeeing is the most obvious way we perceive the marking in dogs. As you might have noticed, urinating looks different in female and male dogs. \n\nDuring puppyhood, a female dog will crouch deep to relieve herself. At the same time, a male will do a more elevated crouch to relieve himself. \n\nDuring puberty, things change, especially for male dogs. Males start lifting the leg, while female dogs continue using the deep crouch for urinating. \n\nIt can also happen that female dogs lift the leg and search for higher places to urinate. This is a sign for marking, and not \"just\" to relieve the bladder. \n\nSome smaller male dogs with a big personality, like a Terrier, might even do a so-called handstand to mark as high as they can get. \n\nMales that pee in an elevated crouching position is just plain peeing and not marking. \n\n### Dog Marking With Poop\n\nThe way dogs poop is more or less the same from puppyhood to maturity. Some dogs that want to make a territorial statement with their faeces will search for higher ground when pooping and/or even lift a leg.\n\nYour dog has left, and right, one to two centimetres from the anus entrance, two pea-sized anal glands that produce a strong smelly secretion.\n\nThis secretion bears the very distinct smell of your dog and is released in small quantities every time your dog takes a poop. \n\nIn extreme cases, if a dog is exposed to massive panic or fear, the glands can suddenly empty as well. \n\n### Dog Marking By Scratching The Ground\n\nSome dogs will scratch the ground after they marked the spot via urine or faeces. This behaviour is mainly shown only when other dogs or humans are present. \n\nBy scratching the ground and assuming an imposing posture, the dog wants to highlight to his audience, that he marked that spot, in case someone missed the marking with urine or faeces. \n\nThe soil that is lifted fills with his scent, and also, will get the smell from the sweat glands on the dog's paw pads.\n\n### Dog Marking By Rubbing Against Objects And / Or Humans\n\nAnother form of marking is rubbing against a person or object. The dog walks close to the person or object and rubs its fur against it. \n\nAs a result, it leaves its smell on the object or person, making his ownership claim clear to everybody watching or later on sniffing. \n\n## Why Do Dogs Mark?\n\nDogs have several reasons why they mark and leave their scent, thus their information, behind.\n\n### Territorial Marking\n\nTerritorial marking can help a dog \"remember\" his way around the neighbourhood. Still, it is also a clear statement to other dogs that this is his territory.\n\nCertain parts of paths, particular passages, borders and other important places are marked so that the dog can recognise and get a better orientation. \n\nSome dogs are more territorial than others. \n\nIf you see your dog making and his body language tells a story of \"you saw nothing\" can be because he has a low territorial claim. \n\nIf, on the other hand, your dog comes after marking with high chest and his body language shows obviously a particular pride of his deed, then your dog has a high territorial claim. \n\nDo you have a dog that search for it feels to you an eternity to do his business? \n\nWell, this has a reason too. He is either a very picky dog and searches precisely the spot where he can overmark, or he does not want under any circumstances to mark where other dogs marked. \n\n<img src=\"/images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5UiqJw4UWtVdiLxLjhizGL/5fbb32a24338b23e343090aa2c45eceb/_MG_0517.jpeg\" alt=\"Why Do Dogs Mark Their Territory\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\n### Relationship and Ownership\n\nTwo dogs that know each other very good or are even living in the same house can resolve to a behaviour called overmarking. \n\nOvermarking means that a dog will mark on the exact spot the other dog marked. It is intended as a signal that will reinforce the sense of belonging together, thus showing other dogs the relationship the two dogs are in. \n\nAs described above, dogs will also mark their humans to make clear to other dogs who the human \"belongs\" to. \n\n##What To Do When Your Dog Is Marking On A Walk?\n\n First of all, you have to allow your dog to relieve himself shortly after going out. \n\nThis does not necessarily have to be done in the first few meters, but relatively at the beginning of the walk. \n\nAfter that, you should not constantly stop and wait until your dog has marked all the critical points, but continue on your way. It is not the dog that is responsible for securing the territory, but you are.\n\nOff leash, there is no point in forbidding the dog from marking by scolding him.  The advice to urinate yourself on top of your dog's marking is nonsense as well. Both would only show the dog that you lack confidence because you act up about him marking, which by the way is just a natural communication way for dogs. \n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2020-01-08T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Marking in dogs is like facebook for humans.

Let me tell you that hit me in my ego sooo bad, but then I reflected and watched other dog-human teams, and I had to admit: I was boring. \n\nStart your walk with a little exercise that will help your dog pay more attention to you: little tug of war, ball, show your dog the treat bag, hide treats and search together, a good game of fetch. \n\nAvoid releasing the leash if your dog is pulling on the leash. That will reinforce your dog to pull each time he wats to go somewhere or greet another dog.  \n\nLet the dog sit, get into a calm state of mind and the release the leash. \n\n### Dog Anxiety On Walk - Personal Space\n\nSimply because the personal space of your dog on the leash is not respected, and the dog is unable to restore it, it can cause unpleasant feelings. Your dog feels pressured, insecure, fearful, thus anxious.\n\nWhat your dog is left with, is the possibility of restoring individual distance through aggressive behaviour. Now your dog shows aggression to keep the other dog at a distance. \n\nIf this behaviour succeeds, this confirms the action to your dog that is on a leash, which in return will lead to it becoming increasingly aggressive in the future to prevent encounters with other dogs.\n\nIf a free-running dog is so stormy on the encounter that he physically gives your dog a body check, or even shows aggressive behaviour, this will further increase the problem. \n\nNow your dog not only has to fear an attack, but he actually suffers one. The leash is supposed to offer your dog security. He should orientate himself on you, rely on your guidance. \n\nBecause the dog now suffered an attack on the leash, he learns that he can not rely on you to protect him, worsening the human-dog bond. \n\nOne free-running dog and irresponsible dog owner will cause your dog anxiety, and set you and your dog, what it might feel like, light-years back in terms of training. \n\nOne way you can show your dog that you can protect him is by stepping in front of him the moment he sees another free-running dog, but your dog is not aggressively reacting yet. \n\nThe moment you step in front, use your dominant and secure voice and with a stern movement of your free arm send the other dog away. This way, your insecure dog learns that you can take over the action, protection, and that he can relax.\n\n### Dog Anxiety On Walk - Defending A Ressource\n\n#### Ressource Human\n\nIf your dog thinks that it has unlimited access to you as his human social partner will also want to enforce these requirements when walking on a leash. \n\nAn approaching foreign dog is then kept at a distance by aggressive behaviour. \n\nIn this case, a change in everyday life in parallel with leash training is essential, because this is the only way to change the dog's fundamentally wrong attitude towards you! \n\nActually, such behaviour does not really correspond to leash aggression because the dog also shows this behaviour while free-running.\n\nYou should take a step back and see what is going on at home. Do you two play when your dog is in the mood? Do you cuddle when your dog comes to you? Who greets another human first: you or your dog? \n\nIf your dog sets the pace with you, then you might want to reconsider this arrangement. Start by taking another toy as your dog does for the play, initiate cuddle moments, let your dog sit while you greet another human first. \n\n#### Ressource Reproduction\n\nIn the case of males, aggressive behaviour is often only shown towards uncastrated males. \n\nIf you look at these dogs while they are off-leash, you can see that they are not really relaxed when encountering same-sex dogs either and often react with aggressive behaviour as well. \n\nTherefore, the aggressive behaviour on the leash due to sexual motivation is actually not a real leash aggression issue.\n\nA proper obedience training and \"heeling\" work will do the trick here and allow you to walk by without incident.\n\n### Dog Anxiety On Walk - Methods On How To Walk On The Leash With An Anxious Dog\n\n#### Method 1: Avoidance\n\nWhile out on your daily walk together, at the sight of another dog just take a detour, go around the other dog putting enough distance between your dog and the other dog, or just turn around in a relaxed manner and walk back like you forgot something at home or in the car. \n\nIf all the above is not possible, try some food as a bribing method. Something that your dog loves above all other treats he gets. \n\n#### Method 2: Carrying A Prize\n\nThis is the method that works wonders for my dog. He loves the fetch game, so he always carries a ball or a tug toy. That allows him to chew on it when he gets anxious. \n\nFor this, you need to teach your dog in the first place to fetch and then to hold things. \n\nFetching is a beautiful way to bond with your dog as well as it will build trust, and you two can have lots of fun. Once you discover the power of fetching and holding, you will become a fan. \n\n#### Method 3: Look\n\nDepending on the level of excitement of your dog, you could teach your dog to look at you and hold the eye contact until you pass the other dog.\n\nYou can also use this in combination with sit and stay commands. It is essential to start this kind of training far enough from another dog to enable a positive experience for your dog. \n\n#### Method 4: Touch\n\nThe touch command is an alternative for the look command, simply because some dogs have issues keeping extended eye contact with humans. \n\n## My Dog Is Anxious On Walks - Conclusion\n\nIn the end, it is all about making those mistakes, failing, trying again and failing better. \n\nThere is no perfect recipe, and what works for one dog might not work for another. \n\nMake sure you get to know your dog and work on that split moment timing when you reinforce the desired behaviour and when not. \n\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team\n"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Training","categorySlug":"dog-training"},"postDate":"2019-12-29T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"How do you recognize if your dog is anxious on walks?

Part","postSlug":"my-dog-is-anxious-on-walks-the-theoretical-part","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"## Dog Anxiety - Definition\n\nAnxiety in a dog is defined as the anticipation of potential dangers from unknown sources. \n\n\n## Dog Anxiety - Causes\n\n\nMost common triggers for anxiety in dogs are:\n* Fear - caused by loud noises; unfamiliar people or animals; visual stimuli like hats, trench coats, umbrellas, etc.; new or different environments; specific situations like the vet, car rides, elevators, etc.; unfamiliar surfaces like grass, wood floors, grills, etc. \n* Separation - caused by the discomfort that the dog feels when he id left alone\n* Illness or Injury - caused by pain, infections, toxicity. \n* Age-related - caused by similar signs as in human Alzheimer's disease: loss of memory, awareness, perception.\n\n\n## Dog Anxiety - Symptoms\n\n\nMost of the times, the dog will develop behavioural problems and/, or he will depict bodily reactions that are causing his panic, anxiety and fear.  \n\n\nExamples of severe anxiety symptoms:\n* aggression\n* drooling\n* urinating or defecating in the house, also emptying of the anal glands \n* panic\n* destruction\n* excessive barking and howling\n* pacing and restlessness\n* repetitive or compulsive behaviours\n\n\nExamples of subtle anxiety symptoms:\n* seeking extra comfort or affection\n* excessive licking or chewing\n* hiding or searching for solitude\n* panting and shaking\n\n\n## Dog Anxiety - Manifestation\n\n\nOne of the most common symptoms is aggression. There are two types of aggressive behaviour: direct and indirect. \n\n\nDog behaviourists speak about direct aggression when a dog acts aggressively towards another animal or human. \n\n\nIndirect aggression happens when a person comes between the dog and the source of the dog's aggression, such as another dog. \n\n\nAnother common symptom is destruction. This form of anxiety manifestation can lead to costly repairs but unfortunately, can also lead to the dog injuring himself. The dog will concentrate his destructive behaviour around exit points: doors and windows.\n\n\n## Dog Anxiety - Treatment\n\n\nFirst of all, take your puppy to a vet and check him out thoroughly. Do a full blood check and talk to your vet about your dog's symptoms. \n\n\nI strongly recommend visiting the vet before giving your dog supplements, oils or any medication to treat anxiety.\n\n\nIf the vet clears your dog, then you can consider searching for a dog behaviourist and trainer that will help you with your dog's anxiety. \n\n\nYou might think like: \"so I read all this for a \"go to a specialist.\" advice?\"\n\n\nWell yes and no. You now know much more about anxiety and might even know the reasons. But do not underestimate the great help a specialist can provide. They work day after day with issues in dogs. So they have a big backpack full of knowledge and tools. \n\n\nThere are also training methods you can test by yourself, although. \n\n\n### Counterconditioning and Desensitisation Training\n\n\nCounterconditioning is a training method used to change your dog's response to the stimulus responsible for anxiety, and replacing the anxious behaviour with a more desirable behaviour, like sitting or focusing on the owner. Meaning once your dog has been exposed to the trigger, you train your dog to provide another response to it as before. Praise like there is no other best treat on this planet. \n\n\nThrough desensitization, you slowly introduce your dog to the source of anxiety, preferably in minimal doses and at a decreased intensity. \n\n\nRepeated exposure and rewarding positive behaviour can help your dog toward managing anxiety, and you also allow your dog to make choices.\n\n\nDesensitization can be an effective method when your dog's anxiety is brought on by a particular trigger like a firework, thunderstorm, car rides, etc.  \n\n\nThrough repeated exposure and rewarding positive behaviour, your dog will learn to reduce his anxious response to the particular trigger. \n\n\nA common mistake that will actually do more harm than help your dog is to try to comfort your dog. This actually makes it worse, because your dog will think you are rewarding him for the anxious behaviour. Instead of comforting your dog, encourage him to act calmly.\n\n\n## Dog Anxiety - Prevention\n\n\n### Learn Anxious Dog Body Language\n\n\nTo avoid negative experiences for you and your dog, you need to watch and learn your dog's body language. A dog's body will tell you very early what is going on with him. \n\n\nKnowing your dog's body language will also help you during counterconditioning, and desensitisation training. It will allow you to reinforce that desired positive behaviour. \n\n\n### Socialise Your Puppy\n\n\nBest way to avoid anxious behaviour is to socialise your puppy very early. Let him know people, animals, places, cars, trams, trains, trucks, fireworks, etc. \n\n\n### Obedience Training\n\n\nObedience training is the foundation for an excellent human-dog bond, providing trust and a healthy relationship between the parties. \n\n\nObedience is a crucial tool for managing and even preventing anxiety in your dog. \n\n\n### Exercise and Food\n\n\nProvide your puppy with healthy and dog-friendly food and treats. This will keep your dog healthy.\n\n\nExercise is crucial for the dog’s bodily and mental health. Go on that walk, even if you are later home as expected, play with your dog, cuddle. Do not ignore or neglect him since this will lead to anxious behaviour. \n\n\n### Avoid\n\n\nAnd if you find yourself in a situation that you know for sure will escalate, then your best friend is avoidance. Turn around, go into the field, cross the street, avoid dog parks, etc. \n\n\n## Dog Anxiety On Walk\n\n\nI will cover in this part, mainly the so-called line aggression since this is one of the most known anxiety out there at the moment.  \n\n\nMake peace with the fact that you will make mistakes, your dog will make mistakes, you will be frustrated, at a verge of giving up and scream and run. I have been there. I was sad, angry, terrified and felt like nothing works and helps overcome the line aggression. \n\n\nMy rescue was a knowledgeable trainer that had a genuine experience with fearful dogs. How did I know he will help? It just felt right. \n\n\nHe never suggested anything that hurt my dog, he told me honestly what might change and might not, also said to me that part of the problem is my fault and he showed me what I did wrong and how to do it right. \n\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Training","categorySlug":"dog-training"},"postDate":"2019-12-22T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"How do you recognize if your dog is anxious on walks?

Puppy","postSlug":"what-treats-can-i-give-my-8-week-old-puppy","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"We can help. I remember doing a lot of food-based research before and after I got my puppy. I asked the breeder what she was feeding him, and I purchased a little bag of the food. I then started reading into raw feeding, best kibble brands, and what treats I can give the puppy during training.\n\n\nDoing the research really paid out in term of getting more knowledge about dog food and because puppies depend on our judgment when it comes to their health, so we owe it to them to make researched choices in what kinds of treats we feed them.\n\n\nSo, now that finally, the puppy is here, first things first, someone has to tell the puppy the house rules. Best way to do it is to turn it into a fun game for the puppy and you. \n\n## 8 Week Old Puppy Food Nutrients\nThe necessary nutrients for healthy puppy nutrition are:\n* Carbohydrates\n* Fats\n* Proteins\n* Vitamins\n* Minerals\n* Water\nCarbs, fats, and protein help build tissue, contribute to muscle growth, and they also provide a puppy with the energy he is known for. \n\nVitamins, minerals, and water help your young puppy maintain the correct amount of red blood cells, and they help him regulate and maintain normal body temperature. \n\nJust like in humans, water will help hydrate the dog’s tissues and keeps the spine’s discs healthy. \n\nIt is essential and your responsibility to pick out healthy treats for your growing puppy to ensure his growth and overall health. The more robust a dog is, the longer he can stay by your side.\n\nWhen choosing the best food option for your four-legged friend, always look for the following characteristics:\n* Protein must be the primary ingredient in a puppy’s food as well as teats. Excellent sources of protein are deboned chicken, duck, beef, or salmon. \n* High-value dog food won’t have additives like dyes or artificial flavours in them, which can trigger food allergies in your puppy.\n\n\n## 8 Week Old Puppy Food Amount\nTo make sure you give your puppy the correct amount of food, ask your vet about it, as he or she will be able to provide you with the right information about it. \n\nThe amount of food your puppy needs to receive per day depends on his breed. \n\nIt is essential to know that puppies require high-value food to be able to grow and get the energy they spend running around.\n\n## What Treats Can I Give My 8 Week Old Puppy?\nSo, after all the above theory, what treats can you give your puppy?\nWe are getting there. One more important remark from my side before I reveal the treats secret 🙃.\n\nMake sure you do not overfeed your puppy. Subtract the amount of treats from the puppy’s regular meals. \n\n### The best treats for a puppy are:\n\n* cooked and boneless chicken\n* cooked and boneless duck\n* chicken liver\n* beef\n* beef liver\n* beef lungs\n* beef trachea (*)\n* beef bone marrow bones (**)\n* meaty bones (**) \n* dried salmon \n* horse lungs\n* horse meat\n* horse trachea (*)\n\n(*) only past 10 weeks of age\n(**) alway supervise your dog when you feed him bones\n\nAfter reading my list, you might think how on earth can you get your hands on all that. Befriend a butcher, or go to your local butcher and ask him or her where you could get those animal parts. \n\nYou can get the items fresh and bake-dry them so that you can conserve the treats better. \n\nTreats are, as the name says, a treat. So make sure you give treats when training when you want your puppy to remember that he did something remarkable. \n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Health","categorySlug":"dog-health"},"postDate":"2019-12-15T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"If you are a new dog owner, and you just brought your puppy home, you might ask yourself “What Treats Can I Give My 8 Week Old Puppy?” now that you are in charge of his well-being.

Work","postSlug":"keeping-a-dog-in-an-apartment-while-at-work","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"If you always wanted a dog, but you are unsure about adopting one because you live in an apartment, then fear no more. We will give you the necessary guidance to make it work and live happily ever after with your puppy.\n\nThese guidelines will help you raise your puppy in your apartment, but it will also help you with your current dog to adjust to a new space. \n\n\n## What dog breed fits you? \n\n\nPlease don't think that every dog of a specific breed is the same. Like humans, a dog brings and develops its own personality, thus making him or her as unique as you and me. \n\n\n## Know your breed\n\n\nIn one of my blog post (\"[What To Do When You Get A New Dog](https://furrycanines.com/what-to-do-when-you-get-a-new-dog)\"), I have already talked about the difference between dog breeds and their temperaments. \n\n\nRead the descriptions about each breed and decide what fits your situation and your temperament.\n\nDo you know what distinguishes each breed from each other? The answer lays in the blos post \"[The 7 Types of Dog Breeds Explained](https://furrycanines.com/the-7-types-of-dog-breeds-explained)\".\n \n## Choose the right energy level\n\n\nIf you are an active person and plan to make your dog to your jogging buddy, getting a chihuahua will not really fit neither your and nor the dog's energy level. \n\n\nInvesting time to read about what dog fits your energy will pay off later on.\n\n\n## List your priorities\n\n\nMake a list of what your priorities are. Be honest and real to where you are and what and if you can offer a dog the right home. \n\n\nHere are some key ideas you should put on your list:\n \n* how much time do you have spare that you can offer your dog\n* where do you live: mid-town, suburban\n* are you willing to change part of your lifestyle because of the dog\n* how consistent are you\n* can you financially afford the dog\n\n\n## Talk to your neighbours and landlord\n\n\nAmong all the excitement, don't forget to include your landlord and neighbours in your decision. You might need to get extra insurance if you are renting, in case your puppy decides to sharpen teeth on the apartment door frame.  \n\n\n## Make your apartment is puppy proof\n\n\nPut **medicine and chemicals out of reach**, also lock cabinets that contain life-threatening substances. Some dogs make it their life goal to open cabinets and get themselves in trouble like that. \n\n\n**Put human food away** too. Puppies with curious noses will jump on counters and gulp down whatever they find there. When you have visitors, ask them not to feed your dog without your consent. \n\n\nRead \"[16 People Foods That Are Not Safe For Dogs To Eat](https://furrycanines.com/16-people-foods-that-are-not-safe-for-dogs-to-eat)\" to familiarize yourself with what human food is not safe for your puppy. \n\n\n**Secure cables** in cable boxes and cable trays, so that the dog can not get intrigued by a dangling cable and start chewing on it.\n\n\n**Secure plants** with a fence or put them in a room where your puppy can not get to them. Some of the poisonous plants are: Dieffenbachia (or Dumb Cane), Philodendron, Caladium and Elephant's Ear, Amaryllis, Daffodils, Jonquils, Narcissus, Hyacinth and Irises are poisonous, as are Azaleas, Holly berries, Hydrangea, Ligustrum, Oleander, Privet hedges, English Ivy, Jasmine and Wisteria.\n\n\n**Teach your dog how to behave in your home**: where he is allowed to go and where not. What furniture he can use to rest and which is not allowed to go on. \n\n\n**Secure your home** so your dog cannot run away by making sure your exit doors are always closet, and you know exactly where your dog is at all times. Also, **secure your balcony** to prevent your dog from jumping out. \n\n\n**Mark glass areas** to keep your dog running into the glass and breaking it and hurt himself. If the gap between the railing is too wide, consider covering them up with a material that your dog can not chew up. \n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4vgTxiTX1n4jhPO5UVSEO6/fcb89a062295be2df864bed05a357022/_MG_5207.jpeg\" alt=\"Keeping A Dog In An Apartment While At Work\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\n## Create a den for your dog\n\n\nIf you decide that you will kennel train your dog, make sure you position the kennel in such a way that your dog can get his rest. Avoid the most crowded area in the house, but don't punish him by setting up his den to far away from you. \n\n\nFamiliarize your self with kennels and crates by reading my blog posts\n\n\n* \"[The 4 Strongest Dog Crates For Indoors In 2020 Reviews](https://furrycanines.com/the-4-strongest-dog-crates-for-indoors-in-2020-reviews)\"\n* \"[How to Crate Train a Puppy in 7 Steps](https://furrycanines.com/how-to-crate-train-a-puppy-in-7-steps)\"\n\n\nDogs like a spot that offers some sort of protection. My dog, for example, loves to lay underneath my office table. So I placed a mat for him there, and even if I am not there, he goes and takes naps there. \n\n\n## Create a routine\n\n\nCreate a routine with your dog around your work and hobbies. Try to respect and keep somewhat the same hours to go out with him. Train daily and exercise your dog daily. I don't mean everyday full 20km run or 2h training. Find the right balance and learn what you and your dog love to do together and maximize that. \n\n\n## Train your dog\n\n\nDogs love to learn, and they are really good at it. Training your dog will only bring you benefits. You invest time in the first 2 years of the dog's life to have a relaxed and fun time afterwards.\n\nHere you can read about how to train your dog \"[Complete Guide On Dog Training](https://furrycanines.com/complete-guide-on-dog-training)\".\n\n\n## Spend time and play with your dog\n\n\nDogs are social creatures, and they are wired to accompany us. Not spending time with your dog will deteriorate your relationship, if you build any. \n\n\nSpending time with your dog is crucial. Go on a hike, go on adventures just the two of you. Play, laugh, cuddle, provide guidance and protect your dog. All this will create a beautiful and unbreakable bond between the two of you. \n\n\n## Provide high-quality food\n\n\nSame as with humans, the dog is what he eats. Eating \"fast food\" all his life will shorten his already short life. Incest in high-quality food for your dog and enjoy a healthy dog with a long, happy life. \n\n\n## Consider day time help\n\n\nIn case you need to be away more than 6h per day from your apartment, make sure you find someone that will take care of your puppy and helps you out. Find a friend, brother, sister, or a dog walker that can care for your dog during the day when you are at work. \n\n\nEnsure that your dog doesn't have to deal with a new person every day. Dogs like structure and clarity. Also make sure that the person you entrust your dog to, also understands your dog and can handle the dog in all situations. \n\n\n## Consider a puppy camera\n\n\nNowadays technology offers your the possibility to keep an eye on your puppy and even talk to him through a camera. \n\n\nA Furbo might be the right thing for you for several reasons:\n\n* you can keep an eye on your dog and prevent harmful behaviours\n* some of the cameras also have a person alert - can be useful if you have a dog walker that comes into your house daily\n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/6sS9bhBf2hPczd2hmT7ImD/2d347ddc0da363cdf376ed96fb89c541/Furbo.jpg\" alt=\"Furbo\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\n<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DAGkgs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"btn btn__primary\">Check Price On Amazon</a>\n\n\n## Consider setting up puzzles for your dog when you are not at home\n\n\nSome dogs sleep all the time you are out, some are still full of energy and need something to keep their mind occupied. Hide treats, hide toys, stuff toys with treats are just a couple of ideas of what you could do to keep your dog busy while you are out. \n\n\n## Find a dog buddy for your dog\n\n\nSocializing with other dogs is key to puppy development. Make sure you enrol in puppy training groups. If your dog is a puppy, do not allow anyone to tell you he can train with grown-up dogs. Go and find a puppy group. \n\n\nAfter your dog left the puberty stage, find a dog that has compatible energy with your dog. A dog needs to play with other dogs too.\n\n\n## Let go of your **guilt**\n\n\nWe all have been there: standing in the front door’s frame, looking at the puppy and feeling heartbroken for leaving him at home. Remember a dog needs a lot of rest, so don’t feel bad for leaving him at home to rest. \n\n\n## How can a dog help you?\n\n\nHaving a dog will convert you in a more active person, in case you turned into a couch potato. That is what happened to me. You will also get healthier since you spend more time outside in nature and fresh air. \n\n\nSome dogs can be emotional support dogs, some can help if you have a disability. \n\n\n- \"[Working Dog Breeds And What They Do](https://furrycanines.com/working-dog-breeds-and-what-they-do)\"\n- \"[Types of Service Dogs](https://furrycanines.com/types-of-service-dogs)\"\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2019-12-07T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Keeping A Dog In An Apartment While At Work?

Petted","postSlug":"my-dog-wants-constant-attention","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"Give your dog a choice, observe his body language, and know where he prefers to be touched.\n\nThe most important rule of petting is: never pet a dog who does not initiate contact. Whether it's a new puppy, your long-time dog buddy or a dog you have never met before, make sure that you always look for that mutual agreement. \n\n## Does Your Dog Want To Be Petted?\n\nThe moment a dog's body relaxes, you can be sure that your dog wants to be petted. He will start to wiggle a little bit or nuzzle up against you, that is your sign that he is ready for a good round of cuddles.\n\n\n## Where To Pet Your Dog?\n\nYou should first pet the dog on the chest, shoulder or between the shoulder blades instead of going full-on towards the top of the head. I like to massage my dog instead of only petting. dog's\n\n## Where NOT To Pet Your Dog?\n\nMost dogs don't like to be touched on top of the head and the muzzle, ears, legs, paws and tail. Don't grab at the dog's face and pet both ears roughly. don't\n\nHaving someone reach out and tap you on the head, no matter how lovingly, is not something most of the dogs accept lightly. It can even look like a threat to the dog, and he can react with a growl, bark or even worse. The same thing applies to any part of the dog's face. \n\nYet most humans assume that dogs like being patted on the head due to lack of knowledge. \n\nThis kind of behaviour and lack of knowledge from humans can also lead to the hasty generalisation \"your dog is aggressive\". See your dog first will give subtle signals (leaning away) and if the human does not get it, then it is time for a louder warning: growling or even barking or snapping.  \n\nFurthermore, because humans do not get the subtle signals, the dog learns that those signals do not help him, and he will directly snap, growl or bark to keep hands away from him.\n\nThe consequence for you, as a knowledgeable dog owner, is to learn the subtle signs, observe your dog and take the correct actions towards a trust-based relationship. That includes telling other humans to keep their hands to themselves. \n\n## Best Spots to Pet Your Dog\n\nMost dogs feel fine being petted on the chest, the shoulders and between the shoulder blades. \n\n Most of the dogs also have specific spots where they LOVE to be petted or scratched or massaged. Here are some examples: base of the tail, under the chin or on the back of the neck where the collar hits. \n\n## Consent Test\nFurthermore, any time you are not sure, do a consent test: stop petting and wait for them to let you know if they want more or not.\n\nRemember that every dog is an individual. They will have their preferences about where and how they like to be stroked. And some are more tolerant than others.\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2019-12-01T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"My Dog Wants Constant Attention!

2020","postSlug":"first-time-dog-owner-checklist-guide-2020","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"The goal of this blog is to give you a checklist of what you need and what you should consider when you are getting a dog for the first time. \n\n## <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2qXUmWl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Food and Water Bowls</a>\n\nWhen shopping for a dog bowl, some considerations including cost, style, safety, purpose, durability, and ease of cleaning need to be taken into consideration. \n\nYou can get plastic bowls, ceramic bowls, stainless steel bowls, automatic feeding bowls 🙃, elevated bowls, and so on. \n\nI personally prefer the ceramic bowls because they keep the water cool a bit longer and in my experience they do better in the dishwasher. I am no fan or promoter for automatic feeders for the simple fact that your dog seeing you as his food provider contributes to the bond between you and your dog. \n\nAnother thing that you should consider is the size of the bowls. It goes hand in hand with the size of your dog, at least for the food bowl. I have a 40kg male shepherd dog and he has a medium sized food bowl and a 2.5L water bowl. I change his water 2-3 times a day, to ensure he always has fresh water available. \n\n## Food and Treats\nFood is a huuuuge subject in dog nutrition. What you feed determines the health and lifespan of your dog. So choose carefully. \n\nChoosing the right food requires long research and ultimately is a balance between what your dog likes, healthy affordable food and how much time you are willing to invest in preparing the food. \n\nRaw feeding requires you to plan ahead either weekly or monthly and takes up some time. After the prep is done, then it is relatively easy to feed to your dog. \n\nFeeding dry food or canned food is much easier than raw, but the quality varies strongly (most of them contain more grains and corn than anything else) and there are only a handful high quality dry and/or canned food providers out there. \n\nReading the ingredients on some of the dry food bags I couldn’t stop but wonder sometimes if they have mistakenly put in chicken food rather than dog food. 🙈\n\nTreats are awesome for training or for the times your dog does something awesome just by himself.  Use dried fish, fish skin, chicken, bananas, apples, cheese, etc. The list is long, but keep in mind that your dog has a saying int his as well. \n\n## Collars, Leashed and Harnesses\nFlat and wide collar paired with a good, sturdy 2m leash and a good harness that crosses the sternum of your dog is all you need in the beginning. \n\nTry not to start suffering from GAS ( ~G~ ear ~A~ cquisition ~S~ yndrome)  :-).   \n\n## Dog Tag\nThere are thousands of websites out in the www that will make a dog tag for a couple of $. Make sure you include your name, name of the dog and your phone number on it. This little piece of gear can be very helpful if a dog gets lost or runs away. \n\n## <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32Ym7eO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Beds and Crates</a>\n\nDogs need their own place where they can relax and feel secure, like a dog bed or crate. A dog bed gives your pet somewhere comfortable to sleep at night or rest during the day, while a crate provides a more secure setting for a dog, much like a den.  \n\nYou can also use a crate as a safe place to have your dog stay when you’re not at home for a few hours or so. For tips on how to crate train your dog read our Crate Training Blog.\n\n## Puppy Sanitary Pads\nPuppy pads are a great asset to have in your home if you have a young puppy in the house. Puppies need to go more often than mature dogs and if you are not fast enough accidents will happen on you carpet, wooden floor, sofa, etc. \n\nTeaching your puppy to use the sanitary pad will help you keep your house cleaner and allows your puppy to relieve himself in case he needs to go really bad. :-)\n\n## <a href=\"https://amzn.to/37fNOTw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Toys</a>\n\nDogs love to play with toys, but some of those toys can be hazardous for vigorous dogs. For example, dogs can tear open toys that have a squeaker or other small item inside, which can be a choking hazard. \n\nChoose tough toys for your dog instead, so you’ll have more peace of mind during playtime. Tough toys are much more durable and provide your dog with hours of enjoyment without falling apart. They also give dogs a great way to ease the anxiety of frustration by chewing.\n\n\n## Poop Scooper and Poop Bag\nCleaning up poop is an inevitable part of dog ownership. Whether in your own yard or on a walk, you know that if you own a dog, you’ll be stooping the poop at regular intervals. \n\nYou can use a poop scooper if you are not feeling kin sticking your hand into a bag and grab the poop. \n\nLately biodegradable poop bags came on the market, if you are looking for an environmentally friendly option. \n\n## Grooming Products (Brushes, Shampoos, Nail Clippers)\nYour dog will need to be groomed regularly with brushing and bathing. Pick up grooming supplies, such as brushes, dog shampoo and nail clippers so you’ll have these items handy. \n\nChoose a brush that’s suitable for your dog’s coat, depending on the length and texture. I personally own 2 different brushes: one for the undercoat and one for “normal” brushing. Of course you can leave out the undercoat brush if your dog has no undercoat. \n\nThere are many brands and variations of dog shampoos, but I decided to use baby shampoo for my dog. It is milder, cheaper and since it is made for human babies, it contains less chemicals. \n\nClipping nails are really handy for shortening your dog’s nails. If you are not comfortable doing this, you can always ask your vet. \n\n## <a href=\"https://amzn.to/37gcrj7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Car Cover</a>\n\nCar seat covers help protect your car’s interior from mud and dirt while also cutting down on the amount of dog hair inside your vehicle. \n\nYou can place these covers over your car seats anytime you plan on bringing your dog for a ride. They provide your dog with a more comfortable place to lie down and reduce the risk of stains. \n\n## Seat Belt Restraint\nWhether you plan on taking your dog on a trip or just for the occasional ride to the vet or other places, you need to have a seat belt restraint in your vehicle. \n\nThese items are designed to keep dogs from sliding around inside vehicles, which helps keep them safer. Some dogs have a hard time staying in one place as vehicles stop, turn or make other movements, and a seat belt restraint helps give them a sense of stability. \n\nSeat belt restraints can also keep your dog safe if you’re in an accident and in Europe they are even mandatory.\n\n## First Aid Kits\nI have two different first aid kits: one for at home and one for on the road when we go on our hike adventures. \n\nMy home kit includes:\n* Non-Stick Bandages\n* Gauze Bandage Rolls\n* Adhesive Tape\n* Hydrogen Peroxide 3%\n* Digital Thermometer\n* Scissors\n* Tweezers\n* Syringes\n* Towel\n* Soft Muzzle\n* Tick tweezer\n* Activated Charcoal\n* Traumeel Homeopathic Anti-Inflammatory Pain Relief Analgesic\n* Bepanthen First Aid Antiseptic Wound Healing\n\nMy hike kit includes all of the above but in smaller doses (no thermometer) and additionally I pack:\n* Whistle\n* Harness (in case I need to lift my dog)\n\n## Dog Physiology Basic Knowledge\nIt always makes sense to attend every two years a first aid course for humans as well as for dogs. Basic knowledge about the dog’s physiology will make a difference in case of emergencies. \n\nYou should be able to provide CPR and tent to wounds until you reach a vet.\nCheck in your area if the offer first aid courses or try online course or books.\n\nSome online tips from my side:\n\n[Mike Ritland - Team Dog](https://teamdog.pet/join-trikos-team-dog/ \"Mike Ritland - Team Dog\")\n\n**[The Safe Dog Handbook: A Complete Guide to Protecting Your Pooch, Indoors and Out](https://amzn.to/2Kx2d4i \"A Complete Guide to Protecting Your Pooch, Indoors and Out \")** by Melanie Monteiro\n\n## Vet\nIt is always a good idea to select a vet before you actually *need* one. This way, you’ll be working with someone who you feel comfortable with and seems to have a good rapport with your pet rather than a vet who is simply nearby, open, or listed first in the Yellow Pages.\n\nBest way to search and select a vet is by:\n* asking other dog owners\n* searching on the internet for vets around you (it makes no sense to have a vet that is 1h drive away in case of an emergency)\n\nHave a card of the 24h coverage vet clinics around you on your phone or fridge or wherever your point of info is in the house.\nIf you travel look up a vet clinic upfront so that you have the address in case you need to get to one fast. \n\n## Health Insurance & Damage Insurance\nPet insurance policies offer varying degrees of coverage. Some of the most common options available include basic coverage for common illnesses and accidental injury, wellness plans for routine immunisations and preventative care, veterinarian plans for regular check-ups and surgical discounts and additional liability plans should your pet bite or harm another person.\n\nSome pet insurance offers plans for dogs and cats that cover illnesses and accidents, hereditary and congenital conditions, cancer care, chronic conditions, emergency and specialty care, x-rays, blood tests, ultrasounds, surgery, hospitalisation, prescriptions and alternative care. \n\nYou can spend lots of money with insurance policies, so choose carefully, calculate what you afford and make a judgement also based on your dog’s health condition. Some dogs are more prone to get sick than others. \n\nDuring my dog’s first year I opted for a basic insurance which only covers accidental injuries, including surgery, scans, hospitalisation, etc whatever is needed as a result to the accident. Additionally to this I go once a year with my dog to the vet to have an overall checkup, including blood work, and get his vaccines done since we travel around a lot. \n\nApart from health insurance it is advisable, if not mandatory (it is where I live) to have a insurance in case your dog will cause damages (biting someone, breaking something, etc).\n\n## Register Your Dog\nGet your dog chipped and registered with the city. It is important to have your credentials stored and linked with your dog’s chip number inc are he gets lost. \n\n## Dog School\nFrom teaching your dog   basic obedience or advanced training  for dog sports, a great dog trainer can make all the difference. This is particularly important for new dog owners. But even if you have years of experience with canine companions, a professional trainer can help you troubleshoot problems and hone your abilities. Plus, group classes have the wonderful benefit of socialising your pup. \n\nTry to ask some open-ended questions so that trainers can explain their philosophy to you in depth. Here some examples:\n* What method of training do you use?\n* What is your educational background in the area of dog training (and behaviour if applicable)?\n* What equipment do you use?\n* What kind of follow-up do you provide with your clients?\n* Can you provide a list of clients we can contact for references?\n* What sort of services do you provide for dog owners? \n* Do you provide specialised services? (i.e. therapy dog training, competitive dog sports training, service dog training)\n\nI read once “Pick a dog trainer as if you’re choosing a neurosurgeon”. This kind of stick with me because I went through 5 dog trainers and made a lot of mistakes until I found a good one. \n\n## Set Goals, Boundaries and Rules\nIt is important to write down and think upfront about what you want to achieve and how you want to educate your dog:\n+ allow your dog on furniture and in rooms (e.g. on the sofa, in the kitchen, etc)\n+ how he should behave in different cases (e.g. postman brings a package, visitors come to your home, wait patiently when you open the front door or car door, etc)\n+ when and how long you can take him out\n+ how long will he be alone, if that is the case\n+ etc\nCheck out my \n\n## <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Xp4X8R\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Keep it clean - House / Car Cleaning Items</a>\n\nIf you share your home with a furry friend, the good news is studies say you’re probably happier and healthier and the bad news is your house quite possibly is a mess. \nKeep several items handy and all is good. \nWhat you need to consider:\n+ stain cleaner\n+ good vacuum cleaner\n+ steam cleaner\n+ use washable bedding for your dog’s bed\n+ cover up your sofa, bed and car seats\n+ put the water and food bowl on a tray to contain the mess 🙈\n+ put water and food bowl in the dishwasher (invest in dishwasher proof items)\n+ wash the dog’s paws when he comes back inside\n+ brush the dog at least once a week\n+ maybe get a vacuum robot (ideally starting with 1800Pa)\n+ separate old towels and make them to dog towels :-)\n\nHaving a dog is awesome, requires some changes and adaptation, but bottom line it is the best thing ever!\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2019-11-24T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Getting a dog for the first time is exciting, but it’s important to be well-prepared beforehand.

Steps","postSlug":"how-to-leash-train-your-dog-or-puppy-in-3-steps","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"## Why do dogs need a leash?\n\nAlmost everywhere a dog must be under control at all times, this you can achieve by leashing your dog. This is legal obligation you as dog owner need to meet. Some countries even ask you to put a muzzle on your dog. So if you travel, make sure to read the legal obligations you need to meet.\n\n## Why does my dog always pull on the leash?\n\nMost will say it is because the dog is excited, happy to be outside and wants to get faster to a certain place. While this is partly true, it is also true that the one that is in front leads the way.\n\nFurthermore, the topic of leading your dog on the leash is closely linked to other areas of life: if you do not control your dog on a leash, it will certainly not be controlled in other areas of life.\n\nBut it is also important that your dog can feel your leadership skills in such important situations as leading him on the leash. If you can not enforce your interests on the leash and let yourself be drawn to each blade of grass, then you probably will not be able to do it in other areas of the dog’s life either. You lose competence in your dog’s eyes. The dog will not follow an incompetent boss, especially not when it comes to secure and defend vital resources: protection, living area, etc.\n\n## How do you train a dog to walk on a leash without pulling?\n\nThe goal of leading on a leash is that your dog walks behind you on a loose leash - in every situation.\n\nYour dog should learn that he must pay attention to you and not you to him. At the moment you may be paying attention to him by constantly asking him to come with you, waiting when he wants to put for the 10h time yet another drop of pee on the grass, or just give in to his sniffing and let him follow each small he finds interesting.\n\nDoes this description seem familiar: dog way in front of you, pulling you wherever he wants to go and you stumbling almost behind him with stretched arm?\n\n## How to stop a dog from pulling on the leash?\n\nFirst of all make peace with the fact that dog training is all about patience, calmness and consistent training.\n\n## Step 1: Training Yourself To Walk Your Dog on a Leash\n\nPay attention to your body language. It should be purposeful and radiate leadership skills: so chest out, shoulder straightened, straight back. Clear your mind of previous bad experiences, breath, YOU can do this!\n\nSet a fixed goal and walk determined towards that goal. Be consistent. Once you leash your dog, you need to demonstrate your leadership skills.\n\nKeep yourself calm and assertive while walking your dog. The moment you lose your cool the tension will travel down the leash and it will change the state of mind of your dog.\n\nMy dog was a dog reactive dog and it took me months of hard work (calmness, consistency, body language checks, repetitions) to get to where I am today: walking by dogs without having my dog react, bark, jump, pull etc.\n\n## Step 2: Training Your Dog to Walk on a Leash\n\n### Introduce\n\nIntroduce your dog to the collar and leash. You can let your puppy wear the collar in the house and you can start leash training in the house first. Choose the correct leash and collar for your dog. Make sure you also feel comfortable with holding the leash and it feels good in your hand.\n\nIt is a leash leading etiquette to lead your dog on your left side. Get used to that and get your dog used to that. Because some dog owners do not train their dogs (a total shame in my opinion - it is like buying a 500 horsepower car and drive every day 30 mph), I thought my dog to heel on both sides, just in case I need to switch sides. I have different commands for the different sides and it is a pleasure to be able to adapt to different situations.\n\n### Teach a Command Word\n\nPut the leash on and just make the puppy follow you. You want to teach that cue that you will use later on when you want the dog to be at your side and follow your lead. I use “heel”, but you can use anything that makes sense to you.\n\nYou will start with cue and gesture in the beginning. The gesture is to help your dog understand the cue. Over the course of time the gesture will become less and less and only the verbal cue will remain. This obviously doesn’t apply to deaf dogs.\n\n### Mark & Reward\n\nWhen your dog is doing what you want, and please understand that NO dog will make a perfect heel the first time training, then you __mark__ the moment and __reward__ your dog. It is enough if the dog starts walking only one step next to you. After that you build it up to 2, 3, 5, 10 etc steps before you mark and reward.\n\n- __The Marker__ can be either a clicker or a word. The word must always be the same word, with same length and intonation. This is why some people prefer the clicker.\n- \n- __The Reward__ is either good ham, chicken, bacon or a toy that is only used for training purposes like a ball, bite tug toy. The reward follows the marker.\n\n## Step 3: Leash-Training Troubleshooting\n\n### Pulling\nRemember why a dog is pulling and walking up front! Yes, desire to get somewhere but it is also because you do not step up as a leader. Check your body language, give the command word and walk like you own the road.\n\nIf your dog starts pulling in a direction, stop and wait for the dog to turn towards you and set him again in the start position - heeling. Give the command again and start walking. Don’t walk only straight ahead. Dogs are not stupid and they kind of know the route and the routine after 5 days. Take another route, the other side of the road.\n\nChange between side of the roads frequently, when the dog least expects it. Turn and go back 10 steps. Turn left, turn right and so on. Adapt it to where you live and don’t do all the time the same thing.\n\nWhen I took my “Canine Good Citizen” Exam (the FCI Version of it), I had to do a certain walking scheme with my dog: walk 12 steps, stop, tell my dog to sit, walk away, turn, go back to my dog and continue with the exercise. After 2-3 weeks of trading I notice that my dog started sitting after the 12 steps before I even got to say sit. Why? Because this little mischievous bundle of sweetness learned “oh heck same thing all the time: after 12 steps I need to sit… here we go, I sit! Boooring”.\n\n## I became boring to my dog!\n\nSo I started then switching things up: sit after 5 steps, after 15, after 10, after 20.\n\n### Lunging\n\nIf your dog is going after something while on a walk — another dog, a car, or skateboarder, for example, try to redirect his attention to you before he has a chance to lunge and create space between you and the target. Be proactive. Get prepared before the target of his frustration or excitement gets too close.\n\nThis type of behavior is more common in __herding breeds__, who like to chase.\n\n### Barking\n\nSome dogs have the habit of barking at other dogs while on a walk. Oftentimes, this behavior comes as a result of lack of exercise. Make sure your dog gets the proper amount of mental and physical stimulation for his breed. If this is still a problem, use the same process as you would if your dog is lunging.\n\nMake sure that you pay attention at your dog’s body language. Dogs will tell you long before they react that they will do that. They can’t say “Hey human! See that jogger coming? His shoes bother the heck out of me so I will go for them when he is in reach!”.\n\nDogs make a very __light change in their demeanour__ to tell what it is going on in their head and if you miss it, then you need to handle the lunging, jumping, barking, etc.\n\nTime, patience and repetition will make YOU better at reading your dog as well it will give your dog the change to learn what is expected of him.\n\n### Leash Etiquette\nLeash laws may require your puppy to walk nicely on a leash and know how to heel when off your property. But, even if they don’t, it’s simply polite puppy behavior to know leash etiquette. With proper leash manners, your dog has more freedom to safely explore the world beyond your front or backyard.\n\nTo those people that are super proud of their off-leashed dogs and are stunned by others that do leash their dogs and shout out ” my dog just wants to play” or ” my dog is harmless”: good for you!\n\nNot all dogs are the same and if the other person is leashing their dog than be respectful and responsible and do the same. Not the dog owner with the leashed dog has a misbehaved dog, but the one that doesn’t leash the dog.\n\nJust because your dog is playful and harmless doesn’t mean that the other dog is and wants to do the same things. You don’t go for coffee with everybody either.\n\nJust because your dog is playful and harmless doesn’t mean that it is true. More often owners don’t know what their dog is doing and what signals the dog is giving to the other dog. \n\nA dog that does not want to play with others and even reacts dismissively and aggressively does not have a behavior problem, but it is rather a natural dog that just likes to be left alone. You don’t allow everybody on the street to hug you either. \n\n__Refer to my training guide for detailed descriptions.__\n\nPuppies do not instinctively know how to walk on a leash. When you pull, dogs instinctively pull back, and if you allow the pup to win, that can make it even more difficult for them to overcome the urge to do it.\n\nIt is much easier to teach a small puppy than a powerful adolescent or adult. If you have a puppy, then now is the perfect time to teach it to walk nicely on a leash. Begin immediately when you bring the pup home. If you have an adolescent or adult dog, here is even more important to walk like a boss and show your dog you can provide guidance, leadership, protection, food, and fun.\n\n>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!
