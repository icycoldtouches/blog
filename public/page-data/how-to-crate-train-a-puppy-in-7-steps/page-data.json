The idea behind this is that the crate becomes your dog‚Äôs ‚Äúden‚Äù and allows him/her to have a place to take refuge, relax, and sleep.</p>\n<p>Due to this ‚Äúden‚Äù effect, crates can be used effectively to assist in housebreaking as well. A dog inherently won‚Äôt usually want to use their sleeping area as a potty. Dogs naturally relieve themselves outside the perimeter of their living areas. Being enclosed in a crate provides the motivation for most dogs to ‚Äúhold it‚Äù until let out to relieve themselves.</p>\n<p>Additionally to aiding in potty-training, crate training a dog creates calm and balanced energy inside your home, instilling appropriate boundaries in the house, and setting the dog up for success by reducing their ability to participate in destructive or nuisance behaviors.</p>\n<h2>How To Crate Train Your Puppy</h2>\n<h3>STEP 1: Introduce</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Find that good spot for the crate in your house (not too loud and busy) and lay an absorbent pad in there (puppies are not yet potty-trained so accidents may happen).</li>\n<li>Place some toys in there and leave the door open.</li>\n<li>Puppies are curious and eager to investigate, so sit down near the crate call the puppy or allow him/her to enter the crate by themselves. It is easier to create a positive association if the dog enters alone in the crate. NEVER force the puppy in the crate, or use it as punishment.</li>\n<li>Once they have entered the crate on their own free will, praise them gratuitously.</li>\n<li>Continue this process every few hours so the crate becomes a happy place.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STEP 2: Mark &#x26; Reward</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>After a couple of times (and I personally do it most of the time from the get-go) you introduce a gesture for ‚ÄúGo into your crate‚Äù.</li>\n<li>After the puppy enters you mark the good behavior with either your marker word or clicker, then reward the puppy either with treats, toys, voice and/or attention/love.</li>\n<li>This conditioning should be repeated many, many times and always with a positive vibe to it.</li>\n<li>The gestures and commands must always be the same and consistent.</li>\n<li>The rewards should vary, in the beginning rarely, but as they grow more often you give no reward just praise with voice and attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STEP 3: Closing The Door</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Once your puppy is happily entering and exiting the crate on his/her own, start closing the door for a few seconds.</li>\n<li>Repeat this step as long as your puppy is interested and not distressed by the door being closed.</li>\n<li>*ery gradually increase the amount of time the door is closed.</li>\n<li>Repeat every few hours until your puppy is happily sitting in the crate for a few minutes at a time.</li>\n<li>If the puppy starts winning then you pushed over his boundary. Take a step back and leave the door closed for a shorter period (it might sometimes mean only close and open directly).</li>\n<li>No rewards/attention/talking if the puppy is whining.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STEP 4: Feed Meals In The Crate</h3>\n<p>This is actually an additional step in case you have a sensitive puppy that is not really feeling safe in the crate or had a bad experience. This step also applies if you want to leave your puppy several hours in the crate when he/she will be an adult and your dog will need water or even food for that time spent in the crate.</p>\n<p>So if you need this step then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place the puppy‚Äôs bowls in the crate (food and water).</li>\n<li>Once the puppy starts eating and drinking quietly close the door.</li>\n<li>Once he/she finished the food let the puppy out again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Throughout Steps 1-4 you need to remain near the crate and observe your puppy and invest the work into the training, but I promise if you take your time while they are puppies you will have a laid back time when the dog is an adult.</p>\n<h3>STEP 5: Leave The Room</h3>\n<p>Before you attempt this step make sure that your puppy was outside to release itself, you allowed the puppy to run, you played and did some basic obedience training. Note that for a puppy this takes about 15 minutes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send your puppy to his/her crate with the gesture and command.</li>\n<li>Mark &#x26; Reward the good deed.</li>\n<li>Close the door on the crate and leave the room for a short amount of time. It is sufficient to just leave the room so that the puppy can not see you and return directly.</li>\n<li>There is no need to throw a party when you come back. If you do, your dog learns that he needs to get excited when you enter the door. Right be cute when they are small, but not what you want when they are adults.</li>\n<li>Be calm, go open the door, praise and give attention.</li>\n<li>Do not open the door if the puppy is whining.</li>\n<li>Leave toys in the crate in case they need to do something while you are gone, but if you already went out with the puppy, and trained, and played they will most probably fall asleep.</li>\n<li>If the puppy falls asleep, then you only open the door when it wakes up again.</li>\n<li>Gradually increase how far away you go and how long you are out of the room. Don‚Äôt move too fast.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- !\\[puppy crate training](../images/three.jpg) -->\n<h3>STEP 6: Leave The House</h3>\n<p>If Step 5 is really comfortable for your puppy, and you provided the basic needs of your puppy (potty, training, and play) then you can advance to step no. 6 ‚Äì leaving the house.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put the puppy about 15minutes before leaving the house in the crate. If you need to say ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù (this is only for our as human, dogs don‚Äôt understand that), then now is the time to do it. Say all the love words you need, cuddle, hug and kiss and put the puppy in the crate.</li>\n<li>When you leave don‚Äôt talk or look at the puppy anymore just leave. You start with 5min outside the building and you build it up to a max of 4-5h if necessary.</li>\n<li>When you return you are calm, no wild and loud ‚Äúhellos‚Äù. Preferably you leave the puppy another 5 minutes in the crate and then you let it out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>STEP 7: Create A Daily Schedule</h3>\n<p>Dogs learn fast and they learn best if you follow routines. So even if you have a vacation for the first couple of weeks when the new puppy arrives, set up and follow your workday routine as much as possible.</p>\n<h2>Example routine:</h2>\n<p>Waking up at 6 -> go to the bathroom -> get dressed -> take the dog out -> come back after potty and some training (some more or some less depends on your dog energy level) -> serve clean and freshwater to the dog -> prepare the dog‚Äôs food -> place the bowls in the crate -> let eat and drink and settle down. Now in the meantime, you do your own things and then crate -> go out.</p>\n<h2>Potential problems</h2>\n<h3>My Dog is Whining in His Crate, What Should I Do?</h3>\n<p>If your dog whines or cries while in the crate at night, it may be difficult to decide whether he‚Äôs whining to be let out of the crate, or whether he needs to be let outside to go potty. If you‚Äôve followed the training procedures outlined above, then your dog doesn‚Äôt need to potty and he/she is only crying so that he(she is allowed out again.</p>\n<p>If that is the case, try to ignore the whining. If your dog is just testing you, he‚Äôll probably stop whining soon.</p>\n<p>Do NOT yell, hit the crate or anything. Ignore until it stops. When the whining stops for y couple of minutes and the dog relaxes and lays down, then you open the door.</p>\n<p>Remember to not go too fast, since this will decrease your success rate and most likely produce a whining and fearful puppy.</p>\n<h3>Separation Anxiety</h3>\n<p>Separation anxiety cannot be treated or abated by crate training. Separation anxiety is a disorder that affects many dogs. Often, these dogs will go, almost literally, out of their minds when they are left alone. It is severe, debilitating anxiety; it is often accompanied by attempts to escape the house, resulting in damage and destruction of items in your home in the process.</p>\n<p>You can treat separation anxiety, but it can only be treated by very slow desensitization and counter-conditioning training. It takes a very long time to desensitize a dog with separation anxiety. There is no quick fix.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postCategory":{"categorySlug":"dog-training","categoryTitle":"Dog Training"},"postDate":"2019-11-16","updatedAt":"2019-11-16","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Kennel train a puppy gives you a big advantage since using a kennel taps into the dog‚Äôs den instinct.
