appearance and behavior of a dog come from.</p>\n<h1>Dog Domestication</h1>\n<p>Dog and mankind are living successfully together for thousands of years. The oldest found remains of a dog are over 15.000 years old. This makes the dog one of the first successful domesticated animals by mankind.</p>\n<p>Domestication means making a pet out of a wild animal. This doesn‚Äôt mean that man only tamed the animal, the wild animal also changed his lifestyle and behavior to live with mankind.</p>\n<p>This process called domestication takes years and years, many generations pass. Domestication always starts with the wild animal that shows less fear for mankind.</p>\n<h1>The Grey Wolf &#x26; Mankind</h1>\n<p>The domesticated dog is relative from the grey wolf.\nThe wolf that at that time lived together with hunters and gatherers, doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. This primeval wolf and mankind shared each other‚Äôs living environment for thousands of years.</p>\n<p>It looked almost unlikely that these two species would become dependant on each other.\nThe wolf and mankind were, and still, are each other‚Äôs competitors about food, which makes it very likely that there was a lot of hatred and envy between parties.\nEven today, this still plays a major role.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt go back in time to see what happened exactly, but with the help of fossils and research, a number of theories have emerged that can somewhat explain this improbable friendship.</p>\n<p>One of these theories tells us that mankind started keeping wolf pups as pets. The reason for this could be that the pups looked cute and mankind had pleasure handling these young wolfs.</p>\n<p>More recent theories have since emerged. The most recent theory tells us that not mankind chose the wolf, but that the wolf chose mankind.\nWolves are real omnivores and could find complete meals around the settlements of man.\nThey lived from our food scraps.</p>\n<p>The wolfs that were least scared for man, were able to eat most of the food and were, therefore, more successful than the timid animals. In this way, a selection was made whereby the tamer wolves could get more puppies and pass on this new behavior to them.\nSlowly the behavior and the appearance of the wolves changed and started to look more and more like a dog.</p>\n<p>These first proto-dogs brought qualities that were useful for mankind. Wolves are very social animals that live in families, similar to those of humans.</p>\n<p>This gave the wolf the opportunity to adapt well to the human family. Also, these dog-like ones could protect their human families, but also watch out for other predators.\nBecause these tame wolves, or proto-dogs, were feeding the food scraps of humans, they also kept the surrounding environment clean so that vermin were kept at a distance.</p>\n<h1>Natural And  Artificial Selection</h1>\n<p>Natural selection made sure that the strongest and most successful survived during reproduction.</p>\n<p>With wolves, for example, it‚Äôs important that they have good hunting techniques and large, strong jaws to catch prey and defend themselves with.</p>\n<p>A wolf that lives on human food scraps does not benefit from strong jaws or a good hunting technique, and these qualities can gradually decrease and even disappear completely over time.</p>\n<p>These wolves were more successful if they showed no fear and aggression towards mankind.</p>\n<p>If they would have shown any of these signs the humans would have chased the wolf away, and as a result, they would have gotten fewer food scraps from humans.\nSelection mainly ensured that the dogs could fully adapt to the lifestyles and wishes of humans.</p>\n<p>Animals would also be consciously chosen by humans because of the good qualities they possess, which were useful to humans at the time.\nThis is a form of artificial selection.</p>\n<p>For example, the animal that was most alert to guard the family or the animal that was the most friendly towards the humans received more food or was allowed to have puppies.\nAnimals that did not fit into this picture and therefore exhibited undesirable behavior could have been rejected and perhaps even used for human consumption.</p>\n<p>This recent theory is partly based on how contemporary dogs are still kept with certain tribes.</p>\n<p>Dogs walk around freely in these villages and live mainly from human food scraps while they watch over the village and the cattle.</p>\n<p>This old way of domestication is still happening at the moment, for example, foxes are increasingly adapting to humans and living in the city. These foxes live from our food waste and even sleep regularly in our barns.</p>\n<p>These animals are becoming less and less afraid of humans and are even starting to differ in appearance and behavior from their counterparts in the wild.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs therefore very likely that the former wolf came to live together in a similar way alongside and ultimately with humans.</p>\n<p>Dogs and People turned out to be the perfect partners and were able to live together well over time. Over the past thousands of years, this band has only become stronger.</p>\n<h1>The Appearance  Of The Dog</h1>\n<p>Especially today there is a world of difference between the appearance of a wolf and the modern dog. There are dog breeds that somewhat resemble the appearance of a wolf, but a dog such as a chihuahua or a pug is very far away.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs almost impossible to imagine that a chihuahua is descended from a wolf?\nAs we mentioned earlier, domestication and selection is the reason that these dogs no longer resemble a wolf.</p>\n<p>They have tried to find an explanation for the fact that many dog breeds look so different from the wolf they are descended from. Previous theories tried to explain this.</p>\n<p>For years it was thought that the former humans chose wolf puppies with a somewhat different appearance, simply because it looked special or nice.</p>\n<p>For example, they would have kept a puppy with light-hanging ears or an animal with a different color.</p>\n<p>Humans bred with these animals to pass on these outer differences to the next generation. After a number of generations, these outer differences can take on more extreme forms.</p>\n<p>This selection is still applied daily when creating different animal breeds and even with plants.</p>\n<p>This is how all different breeds of dogs eventually came into being. Yet it was difficult to explain where these first outward differences suddenly came from.\nWhy did a wolf suddenly appear with hanging ears or different color fur? Why would people select these animals?</p>\n<p>Recently a very interesting study  <a href=\"https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12052-018-0090-x\">(The silver fox domestication experiment)</a>\nhas been published that can give some answers to these questions.</p>\n<p>In 1959 Dmitry Belyaev and Lyudmila Trut started breeding and selecting tame foxes in Russia.</p>\n<p>These (silver) foxes were kept for fur. The animals were very anxious and aggressive towards the people they loved, which made it difficult for humans to care for them and to handle them.</p>\n<p>The idea was to breed a fox that was not afraid of humans from birth and showed no aggressiveness. The researcher tested the foxes at a young age.</p>\n<p>The foxes that were less anxious were selected and crossed with other foxes that were less anxious. This was done generation after generation, and already after six generations, there was a very clear difference between these domesticated foxes compared to the normal fox.</p>\n<p>These foxes showed innate tame towards humans and even wanted human attention.\nThey enjoyed being petted and even started wagging their tails when they saw a human being wet like a dog does.</p>\n<p>However, not only the behavior of these domestic foxes changed. To the great surprise of the researchers, the foxes were born with different colors, hanging ears, a shorter snout, curly tails and even with shorter legs.</p>\n<p>The researchers had never deliberately selected foxes for their appearance, only for their behavior.</p>\n<p>The conclusion of this research is that the process of domestication not only changes the behavior of an animal but also changes its appearance automatically.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postCategory":{"categorySlug":"dog-care","categoryTitle":"Dog Care"},"postDate":"2019-11-16","updatedAt":"2019-11-16","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Dogs are incredibly popular pets, with such a variety of looks and behavior, that there is a dog that suits his or her needs.
