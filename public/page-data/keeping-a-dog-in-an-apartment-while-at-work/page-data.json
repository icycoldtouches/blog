We will give you the necessary guidance to make it work and live happily ever after with your puppy.</p>\n<p>These guidelines will help you raise your puppy in your apartment, but it will also help you with your current dog to adjust to a new space. </p>\n<h2>What dog breed fits you?</h2>\n<p>Please don't think that every dog of a specific breed is the same. Like humans, a dog brings and develops its own personality, thus making him or her as unique as you and me. </p>\n<h2>Know your breed</h2>\n<p>In one of my blog posts (\"<a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/what-to-do-when-you-get-a-new-dog\">What To Do When You Get A New Dog</a>\"), I have already talked about the difference between dog breeds and their temperaments. </p>\n<p>Read the descriptions about each breed and decide what fits your situation and your temperament.</p>\n<p>Do you know what distinguishes each breed from each other? The answer lays in the blos post \"<a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/the-7-types-of-dog-breeds-explained\">The 7 Types of Dog Breeds Explained</a>\".</p>\n<h2>Choose the right energy level</h2>\n<p>If you are an active person and plan to make your dog to your jogging buddy, getting a chihuahua will not really fit neither your and nor the dog's energy level. </p>\n<p>Investing time to read about what dog fits your energy will pay off later on.</p>\n<h2>List your priorities</h2>\n<p>Make a list of what your priorities are. Be honest and real to where you are and what and if you can offer a dog the right home. </p>\n<p>Here are some key ideas you should put on your list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how much time do you have spare that you can offer your dog</li>\n<li>where do you live: mid-town, suburban</li>\n<li>are you willing to change part of your lifestyle because of the dog</li>\n<li>how consistent are you</li>\n<li>can you financially afford the dog</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Talk to your neighbours and landlord</h2>\n<p>Among all the excitement, don't forget to include your landlord and neighbours in your decision. You might need to get extra insurance if you are renting, in case your puppy decides to sharpen teeth on the apartment door frame.  </p>\n<h2>Make sure your apartment is puppy proof</h2>\n<p>Put <strong>medicine and chemicals out of reach</strong>, also lock cabinets that contain life-threatening substances. Some dogs make it their life goal to open cabinets and get themselves in trouble like that. </p>\n<p><strong>Put human food away</strong> too. Puppies with curious noses will jump on counters and gulp down whatever they find there. When you have visitors, ask them not to feed your dog without your consent. </p>\n<p>Read \"<a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/16-people-foods-that-are-not-safe-for-dogs-to-eat\">16 People Foods That Are Not Safe For Dogs To Eat</a>\" to familiarize yourself with what human food is not safe for your puppy. </p>\n<p><strong>Secure cables</strong> in cable boxes and cable trays, so that the dog can not get intrigued by a dangling cable and start chewing on it.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure plants</strong> with a fence or put them in a room where your puppy can not get to them. Some of the poisonous plants are: Dieffenbachia (or Dumb Cane), Philodendron, Caladium and Elephant's Ear, Amaryllis, Daffodils, Jonquils, Narcissus, Hyacinth and Irises are poisonous, as are Azaleas, Holly berries, Hydrangea, Ligustrum, Oleander, Privet hedges, English Ivy, Jasmine and Wisteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Teach your dog how to behave in your home</strong>: where he is allowed to go and where not. What furniture he can use to rest and which is not allowed to go on. </p>\n<p><strong>Secure your home</strong> so your dog cannot run away by making sure your exit doors are always closet, and you know exactly where your dog is at all times. Also, <strong>secure your balcony</strong> to prevent your dog from jumping out. </p>\n<p><strong>Mark glass areas</strong> to keep your dog running into the glass and breaking it and hurt himself. If the gap between the railing is too wide, consider covering them up with a material that your dog can not chew up. </p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4vgTxiTX1n4jhPO5UVSEO6/fcb89a062295be2df864bed05a357022/_MG_5207.jpeg\" alt=\"Keeping A Dog In An Apartment While At Work\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h2>Create a den for your dog</h2>\n<p>If you decide that you will kennel train your dog, make sure you position the kennel in such a way that your dog can get his rest. Avoid the most crowded area in the house, but don't punish him by setting up his den to far away from you. </p>\n<p>Familiarize your self with kennels and crates by reading my blog posts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/the-4-strongest-dog-crates-for-indoors-in-2020-reviews\">The 4 Strongest Dog Crates For Indoors In 2020 Reviews</a>\"</li>\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/how-to-crate-train-a-puppy-in-7-steps\">How to Crate Train a Puppy in 7 Steps</a>\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dogs like a spot that offers some sort of protection. My dog, for example, loves to lay underneath my office table. So I placed a mat for him there, and even if I am not there, he goes and takes naps there. </p>\n<h2>Create a routine</h2>\n<p>Create a routine with your dog around your work and hobbies. Try to respect and keep somewhat the same hours to go out with him. Train daily and exercise your dog daily. I don't mean everyday full 20km run or 2h training. Find the right balance and learn what you and your dog love to do together and maximize that. </p>\n<h2>Train your dog</h2>\n<p>Dogs love to learn, and they are really good at it. Training your dog will only bring you benefits. You invest time in the first 2 years of the dog's life to have a relaxed and fun time afterwards.</p>\n<p>Here you can read about how to train your dog \"<a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/complete-guide-on-dog-training\">Complete Guide On Dog Training</a>\".</p>\n<h2>Spend time and play with your dog</h2>\n<p>Dogs are social creatures, and they are wired to accompany us. Not spending time with your dog will deteriorate your relationship, if you build any. </p>\n<p>Spending time with your dog is crucial. Go on a hike, go on adventures just the two of you. Play, laugh, cuddle, provide guidance and protect your dog. All this will create a beautiful and unbreakable bond between the two of you. </p>\n<h2>Provide high-quality food</h2>\n<p>Same as with humans, the dog is what he eats. Eating \"fast food\" all his life will shorten his already short life. Incest in high-quality food for your dog and enjoy a healthy dog with a long, happy life. </p>\n<h2>Consider day time help</h2>\n<p>In case you need to be away more than 6h per day from your apartment, make sure you find someone that will take care of your puppy and helps you out. Find a friend, brother, sister, or a dog walker that can care for your dog during the day when you are at work. </p>\n<p>Ensure that your dog doesn't have to deal with a new person every day. Dogs like structure and clarity. Also make sure that the person you entrust your dog to, also understands your dog and can handle the dog in all situations. </p>\n<h2>Consider a puppy camera</h2>\n<p>Nowadays technology offers your the possibility to keep an eye on your puppy and even talk to him through a camera. </p>\n<p>A Furbo might be the right thing for you for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can keep an eye on your dog and prevent harmful behaviours</li>\n<li>some of the cameras also have a person alert - can be useful if you have a dog walker that comes into your house daily</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/6sS9bhBf2hPczd2hmT7ImD/2d347ddc0da363cdf376ed96fb89c541/Furbo.jpg\" alt=\"Furbo\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DAGkgs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"btn btn__primary\">Check On Amazon</a></p>\n<h2>Consider setting up puzzles for your dog when you are not at home</h2>\n<p>Some dogs sleep all the time you are out, some are still full of energy and need something to keep their mind occupied. Hide treats, hide toys, stuff toys with treats are just a couple of ideas of what you could do to keep your dog busy while you are out. </p>\n<h2>Find a dog buddy for your dog</h2>\n<p>Socializing with other dogs is key to puppy development. Make sure you enrol in puppy training groups. If your dog is a puppy, do not allow anyone to tell you he can train with grown-up dogs. Go and find a puppy group. </p>\n<p>After your dog left the puberty stage, find a dog that has compatible energy with your dog. A dog needs to play with other dogs too.</p>\n<h2>Let go of your <strong>guilt</strong></h2>\n<p>We all have been there: standing in the front door‚Äôs frame, looking at the puppy and feeling heartbroken for leaving him at home. Remember a dog needs a lot of rest, so don‚Äôt feel bad for leaving him at home to rest. </p>\n<h2>How can a dog help you?</h2>\n<p>Having a dog will convert you in a more active person, in case you turned into a couch potato. That is what happened to me. You will also get healthier since you spend more time outside in nature and fresh air. </p>\n<p>Some dogs can be emotional support dogs, some can help if you have a disability. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/working-dog-breeds-and-what-they-do\">Working Dog Breeds And What They Do</a>\"</li>\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/types-of-service-dogs\">Types of Service Dogs</a>\"</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postCategory":{"categorySlug":"dog-care","categoryTitle":"Dog Care"},"postDate":"2019-12-07","updatedAt":"2020-07-31","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Keeping A Dog In An Apartment While At Work?
