Someone with a service dog may seem perfectly capable, but their dog is necessary for helping them avoid certain allergens or to alert them of oncoming seizures. </p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs take a look at these amazing dogs and their important jobs in more detail. </p>\n<h2>Types of Service Dogs - Guide Dogs</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Guide dogs</strong></em> are perhaps the best known of all types of service dogs. </p>\n<p>They are specially trained to help blind and visually impaired people navigate obstacles and get from one place to another.  </p>\n<p>One of the most unique traits of guide dogs is the so-called <em><strong>‚Äúselective disobedience‚Äù</strong></em>. </p>\n<p>This allows the dog to obey commands but also to make choices based on their own assessment of a situation. </p>\n<p>You‚Äôll usually see guide dogs in a special harness that has a bar for their humans to hold on to for support. </p>\n<p>Breeds such as <strong>Golden Retrievers</strong>, <strong>Labradors</strong>, and <strong>German Shepherds</strong> are often selected as guide dogs because of their calm temperaments and very good trainability. </p>\n<h2>Types of Service Dogs - Mobility Assistance Dogs</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Mobility assistance dogs</strong></em> are trained to assist people with mobility issues such as those who are wheelchair-dependent. </p>\n<p>They can perform a wide variety of tasks including pulling wheelchairs, opening and closing doors, bringing objects to people, and operating light switches.  </p>\n<p>In addition these dogs can also <strong>assist humans with arthritis</strong>, <strong>cerebral palsy</strong>, <strong>muscular dystrophy</strong>, and <strong>spinal cord injuries</strong>, among others.</p>\n<p>Different breeds are selected depending on the handler‚Äôs size, but the dogs must be large enough to support their human partner. </p>\n<p>Most suitable are <strong>Labradors</strong> and <strong>German Shepherds</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Types of Service Dogs - Seizure Alert and Response Dogs</h2>\n<p>These type of service dogs has only been active for about 10 years or so, but have made quite an impact on those suffering from certain seizure disorders. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Seizure Response Dogs</strong></em> are trained to assist their handler during and immediately after they have had a certain seizure. </p>\n<p>Their tasks can range from finding someone to help their owner, stimulating their owner to help them <strong>‚Äúwake up‚Äù</strong> from a seizure, even physically moving their owner if they have a seizure in an unsafe place, bring medicine or a phone to their owner coming out of the seizure. </p>\n<p>There is still no scientific understanding of how seizure alert dogs recognize that a seizure is upcoming. </p>\n<p>There is also a big controversy about even about the fact if dogs can be specifically trained to alert seizures. </p>\n<p>Research does show, however, that some dogs seem to have born seizure detection abilities, and there is plenty of <strong>‚Äúproof‚Äù</strong> that seizure alert dogs do their jobs quite well. </p>\n<h2>Types of Service Dogs - Hearing Dogs</h2>\n<p>For people with hearing impairments, these types of service dogs assist by alerting them when noises such as alarms, doorbells, timers or crying babies occur. </p>\n<p>When the dog hears the sound, they will touch their human and lead toward the noise. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Hearing dogs</strong></em> increase awareness and independence for their owners. </p>\n<p>Breeds like <strong>golden retrievers</strong>, <strong>poodles</strong>, and <strong>cocker spaniels</strong> are often chosen for the role of hearing dogs because of their reliability and responsiveness to obedience training. </p>\n<h2>Types of Service Dogs - Diabetic Alert Dogs</h2>\n<p>Dogs are trained to sniff the air to detect the blood sugar levels on someone‚Äôs breath. </p>\n<p>The scent changes associated with either too low to too high blood sugar. </p>\n<p>This scent is imperceptible to humans, but dogs can pick up on them and alert their people to blood sugar highs and lows before the levels become dangerous. </p>\n<p>Many of these dogs are also trained to go alert others in the household or set off an alarm system if their human needs medical help. </p>\n<p>This provides diabetic people with a sense of security they may not have experienced before having a service dog.</p>\n<h2>Types of Service Dogs - Allergy Detection Dogs</h2>\n<p>The allergy detection dogs use their unmatchable sense of smell to detect traces of specific substances in the air and foods and are trained to alert their humans of the danger. </p>\n<p>This can make a life and death difference for adults as well as for children. </p>\n<p>Often, allergy detection dogs work with children, accompanying them to school and activities so that they have more freedom to move around without their parents. </p>\n<h2>Types of Service Dogs - Autism Support Dogs</h2>\n<p>Autism Support Dogs provide assistance and emotional support to people with autism. </p>\n<p>These dogs can be a big boost in confidence for children and help them connect with other children by acting as an icebreaker. </p>\n<p>An Autism Support Dog can also keep the person with autism from running away, they can often track them if they do run off, alert the autistic person of a dangerous situation, and interrupting harmful behavior.</p>\n<h2>Types of Service Dogs - Psychiatric Service Dogs</h2>\n<p>A specially trained Psychiatric Service Dogs dog can help its handler remain calm and deal with difficult emotional states. </p>\n<p>These dogs can also interrupt destructive behavior, self harming behavior, and even remind their handlers to take medication.  </p>\n<p><strong>Psychiatric service dogs</strong> help provide a comforting barrier in times of distress, and can perform a range of tasks that include protecting their handler‚Äôs personal space and turning on lights before their handler enters a room so that they feel safer. </p>\n<p>As humans learn to better understand dogs and their awesomely inspiring capabilities, the households with dogs are increasing as well as the list of service for working dogs. </p>\n<p>And whether a dog is a trained service or working dog or just a pet, we can all agree: <em><strong>they‚Äôre pretty freakin‚Äô amazing at what they do</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>Even a pet that has no service or working dog training can provide emotional support or even tasks like picking up objects and so on if their human teaches them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!
