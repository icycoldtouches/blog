Before you bring your puppy home you should have thought about what your puppy is allowed to do, what the house rules are and so on.</p>\n<p>If you planned all the details out correctly you are completely ready to receive the puppy and set your puppy and yourself up for a good start. In this article, I focus on the first week of your puppy in your home and the things you should take into consideration.</p>\n<h2>Getting your puppy from the breeder</h2>\n<p>It is time to pick up your puppy at the breeder. </p>\n<p>But when is the best time to do this? In the evening after work? Early in the morning? Or in your lunch break? </p>\n<p>Picking up the puppy is best done in the morning or right before noon.</p>\n<p>This way the puppy has a large part of the day to get used to your house before you go to bed. </p>\n<p>Not every breeder lives around the corner, sometimes you might need to drive a few hours to get your puppy.</p>\n<p>When you have to drive a long way its best you take a family member or a friend. </p>\n<p>This way one person can focus on driving while the other holds the new puppy in their lap. </p>\n<p>Offering safety and care during driving will help your new puppy to get used to the car. </p>\n<p>The puppy will have a positive experience which will help him get used to the car for the future.</p>\n<p>If the breeder has taken the puppies into the car several times, to visit the vet for example, there will probably be no motion sickness. But be prepared in case the puppy will drool excessively or even puke.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that for the first time in its life your new puppy is going to be alone, without his brothers, sisters or his/her mum. </p>\n<p>This means it will be confused and scared and fearful. </p>\n<p>Try to offer protection and comfort as much as possible.</p>\n<h2>Bringing your new puppy into your home</h2>\n<p>Before you bring your new puppy into your house, it is important that your house is puppy proof and that you have the following essential items at home:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Food + Water Bowls</li>\n<li>Toys</li>\n<li>Collar + Leash</li>\n<li>Crate</li>\n<li>A Comfortable Basket or Pillow</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you arrive in front of the door, it is time to open the door and put your new puppy on the ground. </p>\n<p>Give your puppy some space after arrival to discover the living room and other rooms he is allowed in.</p>\n<p>You can even sit comfortably on the floor with the puppy so that you are a safe spot for the puppy to come back to.</p>\n<p>Put a few toys on the floor so that there are things that your puppy can get interested in and start playing with. </p>\n<p>If your puppy comes to sit or hide with you, give the puppy your attention and affection. In this way, the puppy will gather lots of positive experiences with and from you.</p>\n<h2>What if you already have one or more dog(s)?</h2>\n<p>If you have several dogs, it is advisable that, before you arrive home, you look for a place where you can walk around safely with your dog(s) and puppy.</p>\n<p>No traffic, no other dogs, just you, the person assisting you on this day, your own dog(s) and your puppy. </p>\n<p>This way they can first get acquainted on neutral territory. First, hold your puppy in your arms and let the adult dog(s) sniff carefully.</p>\n<p>When both parties are relaxed, you can put your puppy between your legs.</p>\n<p>A short walk ensures that the adult dog(s) and your puppy can be close to each other in a relaxed way and can discover odors. </p>\n<p>It is nice when an extra person is present that can help you, so that you can fully concentrate on your puppy.</p>\n<h2>Develop a routine for your new puppy</h2>\n<p>The best thing is to take a vacation when your puppy comes home. But despite being free, it is important to immediately develop a routine, preferably one that is also useful when you return to work.</p>\n<p>This routine is best put together when your puppy is still with the breeder. The moment that your puppy arrives, you are going to implement it.</p>\n<p>Your puppy will have to pee after an hour, or perhaps earlier. Take your puppy into the garden or to a quiet spot in the park or the street. </p>\n<p>After the puppy did his pees and poops, you reward the action with some yummy food and you go back inside again.</p>\n<p>Because the puppy is really getting used to the new environment in the first few hours, you don‚Äôt want to rush things right away. </p>\n<p>Feel free to make a cup of coffee, fold the laundry, or check your email. Keep an eye on your puppy though! </p>\n<p>Puppies can be curious and get themselves in trouble in no time.</p>\n<p>Give it some time and the little fluffy soul will probably stay with you like your small shadow because you will be a familiar sight and smell.</p>\n<p>Try to introduce the routine slowly in the upcoming days. That way your puppy actually grows in that routine and it will become very normal.</p>\n<p>Stick to a routine that you would also do when you go back to work. Wake up early, go for the morning walk. </p>\n<p>Implement quiet times and training sessions throughout the day. </p>\n<p>Puppies need to go to potty in much shorter intervals of time as adult dogs. That means that you need to know and be prepared for this.</p>\n<p>After a few days, you can start quietly close a door and come back after a few seconds. Your puppy learns that closed doors are a part of life and not a cause for panic.</p>\n<h2>How to Potty Train Your 8 Weeks Old Puppy</h2>\n<p>What is the best way to get started with potty training?</p>\n<p>When you come home with your puppy, after you have picked him up from the breeder, you can immediately start with a permanent spot in the garden, apartment or balcony. </p>\n<p>Just wait and see if the puppy will pee and you can reward with food, toy, voice and / or attention.</p>\n<p>By using this spot immediately your puppy will learn where he can go when he has to pee and he will walk to it when he has to pee.</p>\n<p>This does take some time, it is not learned in a day. If you have a garden, it is useful if you teach a permanent place in that garden where the puppy is allowed to do his business. </p>\n<p>You can take your puppy on the arm or on a leash to this place to have him pee or poop there.</p>\n<p>This saves you a lot of yellow spots on your lawn.</p>\n<p>For in the middle of the night, this is also a nice solution because puppies can be insecure in the dark. After a few days, the environment is known and it feels like a safe for the puppy to wonder.</p>\n<p>If you do not have a garden or you absolutely do not want your puppy to ever pee or poop in the garden, you can choose a spot outside in a park or park.</p>\n<p>Choose a place that is not very busy, and were not too much is happening at the same time. In the middle of the park can be very intimidating, especially when other people and dogs walk there.</p>\n<p>The stimulation from the environment can then ensure that your puppy is distracted and forgets that he has to pee and/or poop. </p>\n<p>By looking for a permanent place every time during the first few weeks, the pup learn through association that pee and poop is done at that place.</p>\n<p>To make your message clear that peeing and pooping are appreciated at the designated places, you can reward with a calm voice and good food.</p>\n<p>Most important is to enjoy, have fun and socialise your puppy as much as possible to enable a balanced and well behaved grown up doggy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!
