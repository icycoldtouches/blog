But you only can find those dog selector quizzes? </p>\n<p>Rest assured this is not gonna be a quiz for choosing the best dog. I‚Äôm going to explain the basics you need to understand in order to find the perfect match.</p>\n<p>In order to know what dog breed is right for you, you have to start by knowing yourself, asses your financials, living and lifestyle situation, and what are the disadvantages of owning a dog.</p>\n<p>These are just some questions to ask yourself in order to understand your personal situation. Knowing this is a great start but knowing the general differences in dogs is even better.</p>\n<p>Dogs have been bred for all kinds of different tasks. Some dogs were bred for hunting while others have been bred for herding. They also have different levels of intelligence which can make it hard for you as a potential owner to control the dog.</p>\n<h2>ARE YOU READY TO BE RESPONSIBLE?</h2>\n<p>Of course, sweet puppy faces, and fluffy fur, and puppy breath are so darn cute no matter what breed you look at. But dogs are puppies for only a short period o time.</p>\n<p>Will you still love and care for the dog as a teenager, adult, and senior?</p>\n<p>Because owning a dog is not sunshine and rainbows all the time. You are responsible for the dog‚Äôs actions, thus you pay for it. When the dog misbehaves you are the one to correct the behavior. You are the one that will feed it, get it toys, play with the dog, take it on walks to relieve itself, provide a comfortable place to sleep, and so much more.</p>\n<h2>What To Do When You Get A New  Dog? - CAN YOU AFFORD A DOG?</h2>\n<p>This is the one thing most people overlook because they are blinded by the puppy face, smell, licks, etc.</p>\n<p>Let me put down some numbers for you:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Average Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Initial Buy Cost from Breeder</td>\n<td align=\"left\">500 ‚Äì 2500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Initial Buy Cost from Shelter</td>\n<td align=\"left\">50 ‚Äì 200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">First Year Vet Expenses</td>\n<td align=\"left\">400 ‚Äì 1500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Spaying or Neutering</td>\n<td align=\"left\">300 ‚Äì 1000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Yearly Vet Costs (no emergencies included; considering a healthy dog)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">500 ‚Äì 1000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Yearly Food (calculated for a medium-size dog, high-quality food price)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">700 ‚Äì 1000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Yearly Supplies and Toys</td>\n<td align=\"left\">200 ‚Äì 500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Yearly Dog Training Classes (assuming a total of 35 weeks per year)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">1000 ‚Äì 1200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Yearly City or Breed Tax (if applies)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">100 ‚Äì 1000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Yearly Petsitter (depends on how often you need one)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">150 ‚Äì 300</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The cost of a dog per year is somewhere around $3200 including professional training. Without it, it sums up to about $2200.</p>\n<p>My experience with a medium-sized working dog is around $2000 per year without the monthly health and damage insurances.</p>\n<p>Bottom line is, a dog can be expensive. So think carefully before you get one if you can afford it.</p>\n<h2>WHAT IS YOUR LIVING SITUATION?</h2>\n<p>You might want to think twice if a Great Dane is suitable for your little studio apartment, as well as if you want to put a Belgian Malinois into a studio-sized apartment.</p>\n<p>If you already have pets or even children, then you need to take into consideration that all pets might not get along with each other and some breeds are not suitable for kids.</p>\n<p>Can you isolate sensitive parts of your home? Maybe you don‚Äôt want your puppy to be in the kitchen or bathroom.</p>\n<p>Also take into consideration, if you are renting your home, that you need consent from your landlord before you get a dog home.</p>\n<p>Are you willing to walk up and down the stairs five times a day to walk your dog early in the morning until late at night?</p>\n<h2>WHAT TYPE OF LIFESTYLE DO YOU HAVE?</h2>\n<p>Do you like to travel?</p>\n<p>Do you work really long hours every day?</p>\n<p>You are more on business trips than home? All these can be limiting factors in getting yourself a 4-legged companion.</p>\n<p>Consider whether or not you are willing and ready to make changes to your lifestyle to welcome a dog in your life. If you are not ready, now is probably not the right time to get a dog.</p>\n<p>If you are willing to make changes, consider the time it will take to provide basic needs such as training, exercise, veterinary and daily care to your dog. Write it down, put it to the side, come back and make a wise decision about it.</p>\n<h2>DO YOU HAVE ANY DISADVANTAGES?</h2>\n<p>The first thing that comes into my mind is: are you allergic? If yes then you might want to reconsider taking a furry friend into your home. But if you still want to take a look at <a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/low-maintenance-hypoallergenic-dogs\" title=\"Low Maintenance Hypoallergenic Dogs\">hypoallergenic dog breeds</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a sensitive health condition or injury, this can make it difficult to care for a dog, especially if you choose a larger breed. Be mindful of your limitations and choose wisely.</p>\n<p>If you are disabled in any way, consider getting a specially trained assistance dog so you can have a companion and built-in helper. Two in one!</p>\n<h2>What To Do When You Get A New  Dog - A DOG‚ÄôS SIZE</h2>\n<p>Don‚Äôt let the size fool you, because, most of the time, it doesn‚Äôt equal the amount of exercise the dog needs. Small dogs tend to be more hyper and need to be worn out.</p>\n<p>Big dogs also require exercise but tend to be a little lazier.</p>\n<p>Consider the size of the apartment and common sense will tell you what size of dog you can accommodate.</p>\n<p>If you have small kids, keep in mind the breed type you select. Usually, the big dog is a gentle dog, but they also sometimes do not realize the utter enormity of their size and can easily knock down kids.</p>\n<p>Dogs are categorized into 5 different size groups, extra small, small, medium, large, extra-large. </p>\n<h2>What To Do When You Get A New Dog - A DOG‚ÄôS ACTIVITY LEVEL</h2>\n<p>You probably already figured out the fact that some dogs have more energy than others and that a big part of the dog‚Äôs activity level is often determined by breed, but it does not mean you can rely on breed alone.</p>\n<p>Every dog needs a certain amount of exercise, regardless of breed or size, so make sure you can provide this.</p>\n<p>This is something your dog will show you while the two of you get to know each other better.</p>\n<p>Be willing to adjust the amount of exercise and attention you give your dog if necessary. Unfortunately, many dogs are given up or even euthanized because of a behavior problem that could have easily been avoided with the proper amount of exercise, training, and attention. Thrive to be a responsible dog owner.</p>\n<p>If you know you can not commit to more than one or two casual walks per day, then you will probably be better off with a lower energy dog.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Newfoundland</li>\n<li>Basset Hound</li>\n<li>Greyhound</li>\n<li>Great Dane</li>\n<li>Maltese</li>\n<li>French Bulldog</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are looking for a dog that can be a jogging partner, agility competitor, Frisbee player, IGP competitions, tracking, man trailing, etc. then consider a Working Dog Breed.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alaskan Malamute</li>\n<li>Siberian Husky</li>\n<li>Boxer</li>\n<li>Dobermann Pinscher</li>\n<li>Rottweiler</li>\n<li>German Shepherd</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you set your beautiful heart on a specific breed of dog and nothing can sway you in another direction, and you can not provide the huge amount of exercise a young dog might need, consider adopting a mature or senior dog of the desired breed.</p>\n<h2>What To Do When You Get A New Dog - A DOG‚ÄôS TRAINABILITY &#x26; INTELLIGENCE</h2>\n<p>Here are the top 10 smartest dog breeds:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Border Collie</li>\n<li>Poodle</li>\n<li>German Shepherd</li>\n<li>Golden Retriever</li>\n<li>Doberman Pinscher</li>\n<li>Shetland Sheepdog</li>\n<li>Labrador Retriever</li>\n<li>Papillon</li>\n<li>Rottweiler</li>\n<li>Australian Cattle Dog</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The smarter the dog, the easier to train in my opinion.</p>\n<p>They will learn commands and action sequences much faster and with fewer repetitions. Once you have a good connection with your dog, you will form a team and you will notice somethings your dog will catch even faster than you expect.</p>\n<p>I proudly own a number 3 from the list and he amazes me each time with how fast he understands me. By the way, he learned to count! AMAZING!</p>\n<p>Training your dog will only bring you benefits. You invest time in the first 2 years of the dog‚Äôs life in order to have a relaxed and fun time afterward.</p>\n<p>And depending on the breed, your dog is willing to learn, please you and have fun each time you go out with him/her.</p>\n<p>Training your dog will create a bond with your dog. It will create a bond you feel deep inside your soul and heart. It will literally be YOUR dog.</p>\n<p>You have fun together, you build trust and respect for each other. Treats that will help you out in different situations: new places, meeting new dogs, meeting new people, taking the dog to the vet, etc.</p>\n<h2>What To Do When You Get A New Dog - A DOG‚ÄôS MAINTENANCE</h2>\n<p>As with all living creatures, dogs can get hurt, they have needs like pee, poop, food, grooming, nail trimming, bathing, cleaning, playing, cuddling, love, boundary setting, so on and so on. Either vet, park or pet store, dogs have needs.</p>\n<p>And let‚Äôs be very open here: YOU are the one that will provide all that. Make sure you can afford a dog: financially, time-wise and emotionally.</p>\n<p>Be ready to connect to your calm, assertive and patient part and be the best dog owner you can be. There is this saying from where I live, that a friend told me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúYou get the dog you deserve!‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What To Do When You Get A New Dog - WHAT IF ‚Ä¶ YOU DON‚ÄôT BUY A PUPPY?</h2>\n<p>What if instead of adopting a puppy, you go and get an adult dog or even a senior dog? Maybe that is more suitable for you and your present situation.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the first year in a puppy‚Äôs life is more demanding. Yes, they are cute, sure I love them too. I personally enjoy my dog now much more than when he was a puppy.</p>\n<p>Maybe a non-suitable, but already adult and trained, police or military dog is an idea for you.</p>\n<p>Maybe a shelter adult dog catches your eye and heart while visiting the local shelter.</p>\n<p>Getting an adult dog doesn‚Äôt mean that you get it and you have nothing to do. You still have to find that common path for the two of you, but it will have different dynamics as with a puppy.</p>\n<p>Maybe you would find it soothing taking in an older soul to keep you company and you will be doing the most selfless action ever by granting a senior dog a good life for the little time he/she has left.</p>\n<h2>What To Do When You Get A New Dog - BREED GROUPS &#x26; THEIR TEMPERAMENTS</h2>\n<p>Here is an overview of various types of dog breeds and their main characteristics. Please don‚Äôt think that every dog of a specific breed is the same. Like humans, a dog brings and develops its own personality, thus making him or her as unique as you and me.</p>\n<h3>HERDING GROUP</h3>\n<p>Herding dogs are very popular as family pets. Especially the collies are excellent family dogs. Their high level of activity and intelligence demand daily high levels of exercise ‚Äì making them awesome at sports.</p>\n<p>They are happier if intellectual stimulation is provided as well.</p>\n<p>Herding dogs are very loyal and very willing to work and please their owners. These dogs have been developed for centuries to make independent decisions while working, so don‚Äôt be surprised or annoyed if they disobey a command if they think it is in the best interest of the situation at hand. </p>\n<h3>HOUND GROUP</h3>\n<p>Hounds are dogs with different talents. Some have extraordinary scenting powers to follow trails while others have an incredible sight view.</p>\n<p>Sighthounds are modest and fast dogs, while scent hounds are stronger and harsher.</p>\n<p>In size, they range from the tall and slender Irish Wolfhound to the short-legged Dachshund. Being very vigilant, scent hounds nowadays are used by the law enforcement authorities for finding missing persons. Sighthounds serve as the best racing dogs.</p>\n<h3>NON-SPORTING GROUP</h3>\n<p>Non-Sporting dogs are a mix of dogs that don‚Äôt fit into any category. Some make excellent guard dogs, while others are the perfect house dog.</p>\n<p>Their characteristics, size, coat, and personalities differ greatly.</p>\n<h3>SPORTING GROUP</h3>\n<p>Sporting dogs are mostly a very active and alert dog breed. They perform best when they have tasks to do or can participate in any kind of dog sport.</p>\n<p>These are not dogs to be kept outdoors because they love to be with their human that they adore.</p>\n<p>Sporting dogs are intelligent, loyal, and devoted to their families. Many love to swim and quite a few of them are skilled swimmers.</p>\n<h3>TERRIER GROUP</h3>\n<p>Terrier dogs are courageous and energetic dogs. Originally bred to hunt and kill vermin, they now are a popular house dog, even as family dogs.</p>\n<p>In this breed group, there are many different sizes. They are intelligent, impulsive and very clever.</p>\n<p>They solve problems that might not need solving or take an approach their human might not like. Terriers are also independent and stubborn as well as dominant and demanding. </p>\n<p>Terriers can be challenging to own because they combine high energy, independence, courage, persistence, and curiosity all in one soul.</p>\n<h3>TOY GROUP</h3>\n<p>Toy Group ‚Äì dog breeds are a descendant of the ancient lapdog or mini versions of hunting/guard dogs.</p>\n<p>These dogs were bred down in size to do all kinds of work other dogs couldn‚Äôt because of their size. Today they are beloved family pets because they are affectionate, sociable and adaptable to most lifestyles.</p>\n<p>Toy Dogs can be loving, cuddly, playful.  Much of their exercise needs can be met by running around the home or outside garden or just a short walk.</p>\n<p>As a whole, toy breeds are harder to housebreak and will have more accidents in the house than their larger counterparts. </p>\n<h3>WORKING GROUP</h3>\n<p>The Working Group ‚Äì Dog Breeds were bred to assist men in any kind of activities like guarding, pulling, search and rescue, sniffing, assistance and even military.</p>\n<p>Their natural need to protect makes these working dogs mostly perfect pets, but they need the proper training.</p>\n<p>These dogs are intelligent, robust, powerful, and independent.</p>\n<p>They need extensive training to be able to cope with their intelligent being as well as lots of exercises.</p>\n<p>Their owner needs to provide a structured environment as well as be a strong and assertive person that will attend their exercise needs and invest the time in the training.</p>\n<h3>HYBRID GROUP</h3>\n<p>A mutt can be the right combination of personality and physique as a result of controlled cross-breeding between two dogs that are purebred.</p>\n<p>Each variety of hybrid dog is typically called after a combination of parts of their original dog breeds.</p>\n<p>For example, Labrador mixed with Poodle resulted in the Labradoodle. Or the Goldendoodle is a mix between Golden Retriever and a Poodle.</p>\n<p>There are many new breeds like this and maybe this can also be a good choice for you if you can‚Äôt decide between two breeds.</p>\n<h2>What To Do When You Get A New Dog - CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Getting the right dog is just the start of what can be a wonderful journey. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúWith great power, comes great responsibility.‚Äù\nMarvel‚Äôs Spiderman</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Honestly, I think getting a dog is a great responsibility but at the same time, it will give you a great power: the power to encounter selfless love.
