"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The goal of this blog is to give you a <strong>checklist</strong> of what you need and what you should consider when you are <strong>getting a dog for the first time</strong>. </p>\n<p>Check out the cost of having a dog detailed in my blog post <a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/what-to-do-when-you-get-a-new-dog\" title=\"What To Do When You Get A New Dog\">\"What To Do When You Get A New Dog\"</a>. </p>\n<h2>Food and Water Bowls</h2>\n<p>When shopping for a <strong>dog bowl</strong>, some considerations including <strong>cost, style, safety, purpose, durability, and ease of cleaning</strong> need to be taken into consideration. </p>\n<p>You can get plastic bowls, ceramic bowls, stainless steel bowls, automatic feeding bowls 🙃, elevated bowls, and so on. </p>\n<p>I personally prefer the <strong>ceramic bowls</strong> because they keep the water cool a bit longer and in my experience they do better in the dishwasher. I am no fan or promoter for automatic feeders for the simple fact that your dog seeing you as his food provider contributes to the bond between you and your dog. </p>\n<p>Another thing that you should consider is the <strong>size</strong> of the bowls. It goes hand in hand with the size of your dog, at least for the food bowl. I have a 40kg male shepherd dog and he has a medium sized food bowl and a 2.5L water bowl. I change his water 2-3 times a day, to ensure he always has <strong>fresh water</strong> available. </p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/3hydqNYFBd0Nj0HxaOSv0a/9302970450401fee554aa3c162597bd6/Hunter_Ceramic_Bowl_for_Dogs.jpg\" alt=\"Ceramic Dog Bowl\" class=\"post__content--image-small post__content--image-left\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/39EVSgz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"btn btn__primary\">Check On Amazon</a></p>\n<h2>Food and Treats</h2>\n<p>Food is a huuuuge subject in dog nutrition. What you feed determines the health and lifespan of your dog. So choose carefully. </p>\n<p>Choosing the right food requires long research and ultimately is a <strong>balance</strong> between what your dog likes, healthy affordable food and how much time you are willing to invest in preparing the food. </p>\n<p><strong>Raw feeding</strong> requires you to plan ahead either weekly or monthly and takes up some time. After the prep is done, then it is relatively easy to feed to your dog. </p>\n<p>Feeding <strong>dry food</strong> or <strong>canned food</strong> is much easier than raw, but the quality varies strongly (most of them contain more grains and corn than anything else) and there are only a handful high quality dry and/or canned food providers out there. </p>\n<p>Reading the ingredients on some of the dry food bags I couldn’t stop but wonder sometimes if they have mistakenly put in chicken food rather than dog food. 🙈</p>\n<p><strong>Treats</strong> are awesome for training or for the times your dog does something awesome just by himself.  Use dried fish, fish skin, chicken, <a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/can-dogs-eat-bananas\">bananas</a>, <a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/can-dogs-eat-apples\">apples</a>, <a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/cheesy-oat-homemade-dog-treats\">cheese</a>, etc. The list is long, but keep in mind that your dog has a saying int his as well. </p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/3JjvUEa4aTGFNIaNSF8963/42063cab4d90d47e2e6865256c8e5c45/B9E71CFA-DAEF-4B27-97A0-592501178ACE_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"German Shepherd Laying With Pumpkins\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h2>Collars, Leashes and Harnesses</h2>\n<p>Flat and wide <strong><a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/the-4-best-dog-collars-and-harnesses-in-2020\">collar</a></strong> paired with a good, sturdy 2m <strong><a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/the-4-best-dog-leashes-in-2020-review\">leash</a></strong> and a good <strong><a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/the-4-best-dog-collars-and-harnesses-in-2020\">harness</a></strong> that crosses the sternum of your dog is all you need in the beginning. </p>\n<p>Try not to start suffering from <strong>GAS</strong> ( ~G~ ear ~A~ cquisition ~S~ yndrome)  :-).   </p>\n<h2>Dog Tag</h2>\n<p>There are thousands of websites out on the www that will make a dog tag for a couple of $/€. Make sure you include <strong>your name, name of the dog and your phone number</strong> on it. This little piece of gear can be very helpful if a dog gets lost or runs away. </p>\n<h2>Beds and Crates</h2>\n<p>Dogs need their own place where they can relax and feel secure, like a <strong>dog bed</strong> or <strong><a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/the-4-strongest-dog-crates-for-indoors-in-2020-reviews\">crate</a></strong>. A dog bed gives your pet somewhere comfortable to sleep at night or rest during the day, while a crate provides a more secure setting for a dog, much like a den.  </p>\n<p>You can also use a crate as a safe place to have your dog stay when you’re not at home for a few hours or so. For tips on how to crate train your dog read our Crate Training Blog.</p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4iNokCas94ZkQbnJfDy5LT/c429a4bb1011338e3dbbb5e3a53e5a86/Veehoo_Cool_Raised_Dog_Bed.jpg\" alt=\"Raised Dog Bed\" class=\"post__content--image-small post__content--image-left\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2UHoGAX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"btn btn__primary\">Check On Amazon</a></p>\n<h2>Puppy Sanitary Pads</h2>\n<p>Puppy pads are a great asset to have in your home if you have a young puppy in the house. Puppies need to go more often than mature dogs and if you are not fast enough accidents will happen on you carpet, wooden floor, sofa, etc. </p>\n<p>Teaching your puppy to <strong>use the sanitary pad</strong> will help you keep your house cleaner and allows your puppy to relieve himself in case he needs to go really bad. :-)</p>\n<h2>Toys</h2>\n<p>Dogs love to play with toys, but some of those toys can be hazardous for vigorous dogs. For example, dogs can tear open toys that have a squeaker or other small item inside, which can be a choking hazard. </p>\n<p>Choose <strong>tough toys</strong> for your dog instead, so you’ll have more peace of mind during playtime. Tough toys are much more durable and provide your dog with hours of enjoyment without falling apart. They also give dogs a great way to ease the anxiety of frustration by chewing.</p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/48EWepLUW4hAOm5pT7CuOW/f8c3a9de41018e9c4c24b850d48c2d6e/Chuckit_Ultra_Tug.jpg\" alt=\"ChuckIt Ultra Tug\" class=\"post__content--image-small post__content--image-left\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JCdi2O\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"btn btn__primary\">Check On Amazon</a></p>\n<h2>Poop Scooper and Poop Bag</h2>\n<p>Cleaning up poop is an inevitable part of dog ownership. Whether in your own yard or on a walk, you know that if you own a dog, <strong>you’ll be stooping the poop at regular intervals</strong>. </p>\n<p>You can use a poop scooper if you are not feeling kin sticking your hand into a bag and grab the poop. </p>\n<p>Lately biodegradable poop bags came on the market, if you are looking for an environmentally friendly option. </p>\n<h2>Grooming Products (Brushes, Shampoos, Nail Clippers)</h2>\n<p>Your dog will need to be groomed regularly with brushing and bathing. Pick up grooming supplies, such as brushes, dog shampoo and nail clippers so you’ll have these items handy. </p>\n<p>Choose a brush that’s suitable for your dog’s coat, depending on the length and texture. I personally own 2 different brushes: one for the undercoat and one for “normal” brushing. Of course you can leave out the undercoat brush if your dog has no undercoat. </p>\n<p>There are many brands and variations of <strong>dog shampoos</strong>, but I decided to use <strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bQY46f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopene nofollow\" className='btn btn__secondary'>baby shampoo</a></strong> for my dog. It is milder, cheaper and since it is made for human babies, it contains less chemicals. </p>\n<p>Clipping nails are really handy for shortening your dog’s nails. If you are not comfortable doing this, you can always ask your vet. </p>\n<h2>Car Cover</h2>\n<p><strong>Car seat covers</strong> help protect your car’s interior from mud and dirt while also cutting down on the amount of dog hair inside your vehicle. </p>\n<p>You can place these covers over your car seats anytime you plan on bringing your dog for a ride. They provide your dog with a more comfortable place to lie down and reduce the risk of stains. </p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5rCtiGfJSFiyyBudnjVN0J/a1442af7f146a846cfcd91784a279802/Dog_Car_Protective_Cover.jpg\" alt=\"Dog Car Protective Cover\" class=\"post__content--image-small post__content--image-left\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2xJQDPI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"btn btn__primary\">Check On Amazon</a></p>\n<h2>Seat Belt Restraint</h2>\n<p>Whether you plan on taking your dog on a trip or just for the occasional ride to the vet or other places, you need to have a <strong>seat belt restraint</strong> in your vehicle. </p>\n<p>These items are designed to keep dogs from sliding around inside vehicles, which helps keep them safer. Some dogs have a hard time staying in one place as vehicles stop, turn or make other movements, and a seat belt restraint helps give them a sense of stability. </p>\n<p>Seat belt restraints can also keep your dog safe if you’re in an accident and in Europe they are even mandatory.</p>\n<h2>First Aid Kits</h2>\n<p>I have <strong>two different first aid kits</strong>: one for at <strong>home</strong> and one for on the road when we go on our <strong>hike</strong> adventures. </p>\n<p>My home kit includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2X89w9y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopene nofollow\" className='btn btn__secondary'>Non-Stick Bandages</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2UHVqtH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopene nofollow\" className='btn btn__secondary'>Gauze Bandage Rolls</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/349IDDL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopene nofollow\" className='btn btn__secondary'>Adhesive Tape</a></li>\n<li>Hydrogen Peroxide 3%</li>\n<li>Digital Thermometer</li>\n<li>Scissors</li>\n<li>Tweezers</li>\n<li>Syringes</li>\n<li>Towel</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2widjpO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopene nofollow\" className='btn btn__secondary'>Soft Muzzle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2X9gFGA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopene nofollow\" className='btn btn__secondary'>Tick tweezer</a></li>\n<li>Activated Charcoal</li>\n<li>Traumeel Homeopathic Anti-Inflammatory Pain Relief Analgesic</li>\n<li>Bepanthen First Aid Antiseptic Wound Healing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My hike kit includes all of the above but in smaller doses (no thermometer) and additionally I pack:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ULdun4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopene nofollow\" className='btn btn__secondary'>Whistle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://furrycanines.com/the-4-best-dog-collars-and-harnesses-in-2020\">Harness</a> (in case I need to lift my dog)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dog Physiology Basic Knowledge</h2>\n<p>It always makes sense to attend every two years a first aid course for humans as well as for dogs. Basic knowledge about the dog’s physiology will make a difference in case of emergencies. </p>\n<p>You should be able to <strong>provide CPR and tent to wounds</strong> until you reach a vet.\nCheck in your area if the offer first aid courses or try online course or books.</p>\n<p>Some <strong>online tips</strong> from my side:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://teamdog.pet/join-trikos-team-dog/\" title=\"Mike Ritland - Team Dog\">Mike Ritland - Team Dog</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Kx2d4i\" title=\"A Complete Guide to Protecting Your Pooch, Indoors and Out \">The Safe Dog Handbook: A Complete Guide to Protecting Your Pooch, Indoors and Out</a></strong> by Melanie Monteiro</p>\n<h2>Vet</h2>\n<p>It is always a good idea to select a vet before you actually <em>need</em> one. This way, you’ll be <strong>working with someone who you feel comfortable with</strong> and seems to have a good rapport with your pet rather than a vet who is simply nearby, open, or listed first in Google Search or in the old school Yellow Pages :-).</p>\n<p>Best way to search and select a vet is by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>asking</strong> other dog owners</li>\n<li><strong>searching</strong> on the internet for vets around you (it makes no sense to have a vet that is 1h drive away in case of an emergency)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Have <strong>a card of the 24h coverage</strong> vet clinics around you on your phone or fridge or wherever your point of info is in the house.</p>\n<p>If you <strong>travel</strong> look up a vet clinic upfront so that you have the address in case you need to get to one fast. </p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/7rX7A29DWunoJwO8eZ8nqc/4cdc47004c52c658ec2e9dba9f3678de/DSC_0767.jpeg\" alt=\"Boxer and German Shepherd\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h2>Health Insurance &#x26; Damage Insurance</h2>\n<p>Pet insurance policies offer varying degrees of coverage. Some of the <strong>most common</strong> options available include basic coverage for common illnesses and accidental injury, wellness plans for routine immunisations and preventative care, veterinarian plans for regular check-ups and surgical discounts and additional liability plans should your pet bite or harm another person.</p>\n<p>Some pet insurance offers plans for dogs that cover illnesses and accidents, hereditary and congenital conditions, cancer care, chronic conditions, emergency and specialty care, x-rays, blood tests, ultrasounds, surgery, hospitalisation, prescriptions and alternative care. </p>\n<p>You can spend lots of money with insurance policies, so choose carefully, calculate what you afford and make a judgement also based on your dog’s health condition. <strong>Some dogs are more prone to get sick than others</strong>. </p>\n<p>During my dog’s first year I opted for a basic insurance which only covers accidental injuries, including surgery, scans, hospitalisation, etc whatever is needed as a result to the accident. </p>\n<p>Additionally to this I go <strong>once a year</strong> with my dog to the vet to have an overall checkup, including blood work, and get his vaccines done since we travel around a lot. </p>\n<p>Apart from health insurance it is advisable, if not mandatory (it is where I live) to have a insurance in case your dog will cause damages (biting someone, breaking something, etc). Normally insurances offer <strong>packages</strong> that cover bother medical as well as damage insurance. </p>\n<h2>Register Your Dog</h2>\n<p>Get your dog <strong>chipped and registered</strong> with the city. It is important to have your credentials stored and linked with your dog’s chip number in case he gets lost. </p>\n<h2>Dog School</h2>\n<p>From teaching your dog <strong>basic obedience</strong> or <strong>advanced training</strong>  for dog sports, a great dog trainer can make all the difference. This is particularly <strong>important for new dog owners</strong>. </p>\n<p>But even if you have years of experience with canine companions, a professional trainer can help you troubleshoot problems and hone your abilities. Plus, <strong>group classes</strong> have the wonderful benefit of socialising your pup. </p>\n<p>Try to ask some open-ended questions so that <strong>trainers can explain their philosophy to you in depth</strong>. Here some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What <strong>method of training</strong> do you use?</li>\n<li>What is your educational background in the area of <strong>dog training and behaviour</strong>?</li>\n<li>What <strong>equipment</strong> do you use?</li>\n<li>What kind of <strong>follow-up</strong> do you provide with your clients?</li>\n<li>Can you provide a <strong>list of clients</strong> we can contact for references?</li>\n<li>What sort of <strong>services</strong> do you provide for dog owners? </li>\n<li>Do you provide <strong>specialised services</strong>? (i.e. therapy dog training, competitive dog sports training, service dog training)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I read once <strong>“Pick a dog trainer as if you’re choosing a neurosurgeon”</strong>. This kind of stick with me because I went through 5 dog trainers and made a lot of mistakes until I found a good one. </p>\n<h2>Set Goals, Boundaries and Rules</h2>\n<p>It is important to write down and think upfront about what you want to achieve and how you want to educate your dog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>allow</strong> your dog on furniture and in rooms (e.g. on the sofa, in the kitchen, etc)</li>\n<li>how he should behave in <strong>different cases</strong> (e.g. postman brings a package, visitors come to your home, wait patiently when you open the front door or car door, etc)</li>\n<li>when and how long you can <strong>take him out</strong></li>\n<li><strong>how long will he be alone</strong>, if that is the case</li>\n<li>etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be aware of what you allow your puppy to do, just because he is small and cute and light weighted. Some things are probably not what you want him to do as soon as he is a grown dog. Be consistent from the beginning. </p>\n<p>Example:\nIf you don't want your dog to jump on you when you come home when he is a grown up, then practice that from the moment he is home. Make him sit instead. </p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4f9SPb2ol3Q7OaJKw1TcLa/6ff6668232f840c20cf0efcea9ab18f7/_DSC1362.jpeg\" alt=\"First Time Dog Owner Checklist\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h2>Keep it clean - House / Car Cleaning Items</h2>\n<p>If you share your home with a furry friend, the good news is you’re probably <strong>happier</strong> and <strong>healthier</strong> and the bad news is your house quite possibly is a <strong>mess</strong>. </p>\n<p>Keep several items handy and all is good. <strong>What you need to consider:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>stain cleaner</li>\n<li>good vacuum cleaner</li>\n<li>steam cleaner</li>\n<li>use washable bedding for your dog’s bed</li>\n<li>cover up your sofa, bed and car seats</li>\n<li>put the water and food bowl on a tray to contain the mess 🙈</li>\n<li>put water and food bowl in the dishwasher (invest in dishwasher proof items)</li>\n<li>wash the dog’s paws when he comes back inside</li>\n<li>brush the dog at least once a week</li>\n<li>maybe get a vacuum robot (ideally starting with 1800Pa)</li>\n<li>separate old towels and make them to dog towels :-)</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4bXhv3NSL5AFOryJMcUo9j/4051595ff71b6f6046823d1a1645d11d/61wsUsz9kcL._AC_SL1000_.jpg\" alt=\"Bissell 2225N Crosswave Pet Pro 3 in 1 Floor

"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>A dog's body language is both obvious and subtle, almost hidden. Sometimes you see the signals and know precisely what is going on, and sometimes you wonder what just happened.</p>\n<p><strong>If the dog looks over the bridge of the nose held down, the situation is serious. He is now seriously prepared to face a conflict.</strong></p>\n<p>This means for the dog owner to pay attention and de-escalate the situation. You can do that by turning around and calling your dog, i.e. putting distance between your dog and whatever made him get serious.</p>\n<p><strong>If the dog looks up at someone and the bridge of your nose stays up, it is a sign of insecurity.</strong></p>\n<p>The eye contact with the other dog should be interrupted so that the uncertainty of the dog is not increased. </p>\n<p>If eye contact is maintained too long, sensitive dogs, in particular, could feel threatened. </p>\n<p>On the one hand, this can lead to the dog feeling so cornered that it starts an attack. On the other hand, it can also lead to the dog losing confidence, feeling more and more insecure.</p>\n<h2>Aggressive Dog Body Language</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The dog is looking at someone with a lowered nose bridge.</li>\n<li>Ears are up and forward</li>\n<li>The dog is making himself look bigger</li>\n<li>His tail is high and rigid</li>\n<li>The hackles are up</li>\n<li>His body weight is forward and ready to lunge</li>\n<li>He will be staring directly at his opponent</li>\n<li>Teeth are exposed by a vertically top raised lip, and the nose is wrinkled</li>\n<li>The dog might be growling, snarling or low pitched barking</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Signs A Dog Is Scared - Fearful Dog Body Language</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The dog is looking at someone with high held nose bridge.</li>\n<li>The eyes are wide and rounded, and you can see the white part of the eyeball. A fearful dog will most likely look away from you or the other dog. </li>\n<li>The dog leans his weight on the slightly lowered hind legs, with the shoulder area somewhat lowered and the head stretched forward. This weight distribution makes the dog look smaller and allows it to escape more quickly.</li>\n<li>The more insecure or submissive a dog is, the more it bends his back and makes a kind of hump.</li>\n<li>When a dog raises his hackles is a sign of insecurity or excitement. </li>\n<li>If you meet an insecure dog, you should not seek direct eye contact. In prolonged eye contact, he recognises a threat and would become even more insecure. He can lash out, bark, jump even bite if the dog feels cornered. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sign Of A Confident Dog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The self-confident dog shifts his weight to the straight front legs. Thereby he holds his head straight up and in the direction of his interest and lowers the muzzle slightly. The tail is carried horizontally, at most slightly raised, the back is straight.#</li>\n<li>If the dog is self-confident, impresses or threatens, it keeps its back all the more straight and pushes its limbs stiffly through.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dog Posture Meaning</h2>\n<p>By learning and observing your dog, you will see that he is continuously telling you exactly how he feels and what his intentions are.\nYou just have to know what to look for and be able to interpret it.</p>\n<p>By learning your dog's posture, meaning and language, you will be able to notice little signs of stress, anger or confusion when they occur.  You can now adjust your behaviour (and other's) to trigger aggression or any distress caused to your dog.</p>\n<p>A bond with your dog is a two-way relationship, based on trust, love, respect and two-way communication and understanding. </p>\n<p>Your dog is continuously watching and learning all he can about you, adjusting his behaviour at times to suit what he sees. It's only fair that you do the same towards him.</p>\n<p>Trust, respect, love &#x26; communication. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"🍂Hiker Girl \n🐶Thor, the GSD and Belgian Malinois mix, is my soul dog\n📷Humble Photographer\n🤸‍♀️ Yogi\n🌠Stardust\n☕ 🍫🥑Lover\n\n"},"authorImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=566&h=566&q=50 566w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"authorSlug":"alexandra","authorName":"Alexandra"},"createdAt":"2020-12-06T12:00:54.629Z"}},{"node":{"updatedAt":"2020-11-22T12:00:43.558Z","postTitle":"Dog Posture Meaning - Dog Body Movement Language","postSlug":"dog-posture-meaning-dog-body-movement-language","postFeaturedImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4988290398126465,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5OC0LWuiNOyj0m09Qz3j5X/0556a352edf4526d85e882cb234216c0/_DSC3588-Edit.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5OC0LWuiNOyj0m09Qz3j5X/0556a352edf4526d85e882cb234216c0/_DSC3588-Edit.jpeg?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5OC0LWuiNOyj0m09Qz3j5X/0556a352edf4526d85e882cb234216c0/_DSC3588-Edit.jpeg?w=400&h=267&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5OC0LWuiNOyj0m09Qz3j5X/0556a352edf4526d85e882cb234216c0/_DSC3588-Edit.jpeg?w=800&h=534&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5OC0LWuiNOyj0m09Qz3j5X/0556a352edf4526d85e882cb234216c0/_DSC3588-Edit.jpeg?w=1200&h=801&q=50 1200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5OC0LWuiNOyj0m09Qz3j5X/0556a352edf4526d85e882cb234216c0/_DSC3588-Edit.jpeg?w=1280&h=854&q=50 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Dogs use 3 ways of movement: walking pace, trotting and galloping.</p>\n<h2>Walking Pace</h2>\n<p>This form of moving forward is seldomly used. It is a slow way to move forward. A younger or adult dog uses walking pace only for a short period of times. Mostly it is used by elderly or sick dogs.</p>\n<h2>Stalking</h2>\n<p>Stalking is shown by a dog either shortly before he attacks or lunges after the prey. It can be part of playtime as well. </p>\n<p>The dog will lower his head to be in line with his back, focuses and stalks his opponent. This action is followed by either a fake attack or a heavy body contact play. </p>\n<h2>Trotting</h2>\n<p>It is the most preferred way of moving forward for a healthy adult dog. </p>\n<p>The diagonal legs (front and back) will lift from the ground at the same time. In between the dog floats above the ground. </p>\n<h3>Side Trotting</h3>\n<p>The legs on the same side will be lifted at the same time from the ground. </p>\n<p>This way of trotting is used by dogs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>that are very tired, since it is a very energy-saving way of moving</li>\n<li>that have issues with their back or their gate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes dogs use this type of movement because their human is to fast for their walking pace, but too slow for their regular trotting. Used if the dog has to walk for an extended period on the leash with their human. </p>\n<h3>Imposing Trotting</h3>\n<p>An elegant looking trot used to impose on other dogs or humans. </p>\n<p>Features of imposing trotting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The steps the dog takes are bouncy</li>\n<li>his body is raised, chest broadened</li>\n<li>his tail is raised up high</li>\n<li>his ears are forward towards the person or dog he is imposing on</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Gallop</h2>\n<p>This is the fastest way a dog can move. We distinguish between an imposing gallop and a chasing gallop. </p>\n<h3>Imposing Gallop</h3>\n<p>The imposing gallop is used by the dog in a fake attack while playing. The dog looks like he is hopping like a bunny towards his play partner.  </p>\n<p>Features of the imposing gallop:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>his back is straight</li>\n<li>his tail is up high</li>\n<li>he is pounding the ground with his front legs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Chasing gallop</h3>\n<p>The dog uses this type of movement when he is chasing after prey. This is the fastest way a dog can move forward. </p>\n<p>Features of chasing gallop:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>front legs stretch far to the front, the hind legs will firmly push into the ground to send the dog as far forward as possible</li>\n<li>the tail is raised on the same hight as the back</li>\n<li>the head is also held at the same hight as the back</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"🍂Hiker Girl \n🐶Thor, the GSD and Belgian Malinois mix, is my soul dog\n📷Humble Photographer\n🤸‍♀️ Yogi\n🌠Stardust\n☕ 🍫🥑Lover\n\n"},"authorImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=566&h=566&q=50 566w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"authorSlug":"alexandra","authorName":"Alexandra"},"createdAt":"2020-11-22T12:00:43.558Z"}},{"node":{"updatedAt":"2020-11-08T12:00:50.418Z","postTitle":"Dog Posture Meaning - How To Read Dog Tails","postSlug":"dog-posture-meaning-how-to-read-dog-tails","postFeaturedImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/29gGwjv0VIrW5Hik0Fok59/8c396fc1867bc5280f2f7365f4901da0/_MG_4139.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/29gGwjv0VIrW5Hik0Fok59/8c396fc1867bc5280f2f7365f4901da0/_MG_4139.jpeg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/29gGwjv0VIrW5Hik0Fok59/8c396fc1867bc5280f2f7365f4901da0/_MG_4139.jpeg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/29gGwjv0VIrW5Hik0Fok59/8c396fc1867bc5280f2f7365f4901da0/_MG_4139.jpeg?w=800&h=800&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/29gGwjv0VIrW5Hik0Fok59/8c396fc1867bc5280f2f7365f4901da0/_MG_4139.jpeg?w=1200&h=1200&q=50 1200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/29gGwjv0VIrW5Hik0Fok59/8c396fc1867bc5280f2f7365f4901da0/_MG_4139.jpeg?w=1280&h=1280&q=50 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Although widespread, a dog does not wag its tail just for fun. It indicates thereby, first of all, only excitement. This excitement can be of joyful nature, but also a threatening gesture.</p>\n<p>If you are aware of the many meanings of the tail wagging, you will also understand the difficulty in communicating a tail docked dog has. It is hardly possible for him to communicate with his stunted tail tip. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, such dogs are often misunderstood by other dogs without being aware of the problem themselves. To the other dog, it looks as if the dog is retracting its tail, even if he is threatening, for example.</p>\n<h2>Tail Wagging - Quick Tail Wagging</h2>\n<p>Fast wagging is a sign of excitement or tension. The quicker the dog is wagging his tail, the higher his state of excitement. </p>\n<p>A dog with a long tail will wag more widely and more slowly. A dog with a short tail, on the other hand, will move back and forth very quickly and briefly, almost even vibrate. </p>\n<h2>Tail Wagging - Slow Tail Wagging With The Tip Of the Tail</h2>\n<p>The dog shows this type of tail wagging as a reaction to attention he is given or the return of his family members. </p>\n<p>It can also express a friendly and appeasing mood towards the higher ranking dog. Puppies show this waving almost exclusively when greeting their parents.</p>\n<h2>Tail Wagging - Vibrating Tail Wagging With The Tip Of the Tail</h2>\n<p>The dog shows this type of tail wagging when he meets a competitor. The two dogs circle around each other and assess the strength and intentions of the other.</p>\n<h2>Tail Wagging - Swinging Tail Wagging</h2>\n<p>When a dog shows a swinging tail wagging, the tail swings slightly side to side. Thereby the head is somewhat lowered, and the dog stares at the opposite person or dog. This behaviour is a threatening one. The dog threatens the opponent to start an attack if he comes towards him now.</p>\n<h2>Tail Wagging - One-Sided Tail Wagging</h2>\n<p>The dog can also wag strongly to one side only. This behaviour can be seen, for example, when a dog stands next to a human. </p>\n<p>If the dog increasingly waves in the direction of the human. The human is perfumed with the scent of the dog, so to say the dog is marking his human.</p>\n<h2>Tail Wagging - Wide Tail Wagging</h2>\n<p>The broad waving is not threatening but friendly and is a sign that the dog is doing well. It is often shown during the play, where it is supported by growling and barking. The sounds are not a sign of relaxation, though. </p>\n<h2>Tail Wagging - Wide In Form Of 8 Tail Wagging</h2>\n<p>The dog shows the broad tail wagging in the shape of an eight only at the most vigorous excitement! This wagging can be seen, for example, when a sexually active male dog meets a lady. </p>\n<h2>Tail Wagging - Wide Tail Wagging With Hip Movement</h2>\n<p>The dog shows this very friendly tail wagging when he greets another friendly dog or his family. The more the dog lowers its backside, the more excited it is. This submissive wagging is often supported by hectic licking or licking into the air. The dog’s head is lowered and slightly turned to the side.</p>\n<h2>Tail Wagging - Slow Tail Wagging With Lowered Tail</h2>\n<p>As long as the tail is neither high nor low, but slightly lowered, the dog shows insecurity about the situation or uncertainty about his own actions. As soon as the uncertainty subsides or increases strongly, he will raise or lower his tail again.</p>\n<h2>Tail Position - Tail Showing Downwards</h2>\n<p>A dog with a loose, downward hanging tail gives a signal for calmness and relaxation. The dog stands loose and relaxed with its weight on all four paws, its attention is not directed in any particular direction.</p>\n<h2>Tail Position - Tail Is Loosely Parallel To The Ground Without Movement</h2>\n<p>The dog shows attention. This is the position he shows, for example, when a person approaches or when he hears a sound that attracts his attention. Both the arrival of the person and the sound are not considered threatening by him.</p>\n<h2>Tail Position - Tail Is Rigidly Parallel To The Ground Without Movement</h2>\n<p>The rigid tail indicates increased alert and/or aggression, e.g. when foreign dogs approach. Even in competitive situations, dogs signal their mood until the situation is resolved.</p>\n<h2>Tail Position - Tail Is Upright Slightly Curved Over The Back</h2>\n<p>This dog shows imposing behaviour, which is expressed by the tail being curved or bent over his back. A dog shows this posture, for example, when it meets a competitor. He does not want to embarrass himself in front of the other dog. Still, he does not yet assess the situation as seriously threatening.</p>\n<h2>Tail Position - Tail Is Completely Curved Over The Back</h2>\n<p>This dog does not expect any threat, on the contrary, he is self-confident. </p>\n<p>The tail completely curved over the back can be a sign of absolute social security. Some dogs often enough overplay their insecurity in a particular situation by pretending a strong presence. </p>\n<h2>Tail Position - Tail Is Completely Lowered And Somewhat Pinched Between The Legs</h2>\n<p>If the hind legs are stretched, this position signals psychological stress, pain or illness. </p>\n<p>If the hind legs are bent, and the hips are lowered, this position signals that the dog is insecure, shows fear or worry. </p>\n<h2>Tail Position - Tail Is Completely Pinched Between The Legs</h2>\n<p>The deeper the dog holds the tail and the more he clamps it between his hind legs, the more uncertain he is. </p>\n<p>This position is taken by dogs that want to show as less presence as possible to make it clear to the other dog that they do not wish to provoke them.</p>\n<p>This posture is also an essential signal for appeasement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"🍂Hiker Girl \n🐶Thor, the GSD and Belgian Malinois mix, is my soul dog\n📷Humble Photographer\n🤸‍♀️ Yogi\n🌠Stardust\n☕ 🍫🥑Lover\n\n"},"authorImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=566&h=566&q=50 566w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"authorSlug":"alexandra","authorName":"Alexandra"},"createdAt":"2020-11-08T12:00:50.418Z"}},{"node":{"updatedAt":"2020-10-25T12:00:45.409Z","postTitle":"Dog Posture Meaning - Dog Body Language","postSlug":"dog-posture-meaning-dog-body-language","postFeaturedImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4988290398126465,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/72PeJxrtTA41nUVlDBl0Ij/94a8f2cc3c9238170c1ec7769babdec5/DSC_0728.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/72PeJxrtTA41nUVlDBl0Ij/94a8f2cc3c9238170c1ec7769babdec5/DSC_0728.jpeg?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/72PeJxrtTA41nUVlDBl0Ij/94a8f2cc3c9238170c1ec7769babdec5/DSC_0728.jpeg?w=400&h=267&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/72PeJxrtTA41nUVlDBl0Ij/94a8f2cc3c9238170c1ec7769babdec5/DSC_0728.jpeg?w=800&h=534&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/72PeJxrtTA41nUVlDBl0Ij/94a8f2cc3c9238170c1ec7769babdec5/DSC_0728.jpeg?w=1200&h=801&q=50 1200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/72PeJxrtTA41nUVlDBl0Ij/94a8f2cc3c9238170c1ec7769babdec5/DSC_0728.jpeg?w=1280&h=854&q=50 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>How a dog positions his body and what type of body positions he adopts is also paramount for the communication towards us humans as well as towards other dogs.</p>\n<h2>The T-Position Dog Body Language</h2>\n<p>The T-position is an active territorial limitation of the opposite dog, where one dog stands in the way of the other, crossing his path so to speak. </p>\n<p>Two dogs meet each other, sniff each other, turn in circles until one, more active dog overtakes the other and stands dominantly crosswise in front of him. </p>\n<p>In such situations, dog owners should leave in opposite directions quickly but not hectically, to de-escalate the situation. </p>\n<p>If the other dog does not accept the dominant position of the first dog, he can show this by ignorance and pass the rear of the first dog. </p>\n<p>If the oppressed dog shows himself submissive towards the dominant one, e.g. by turning its head or even its whole body away, the situation can also relax, as this has been clarified first.</p>\n<h2>Relaxed Dog Body Language</h2>\n<p>To understand all the different meanings of your dog’s body language, you first have to recognise and understand what your dog looks like in a relaxed state. </p>\n<p>These are the features of a relaxed dog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>he stands on his all four paws with slightly bent hind legs</li>\n<li>his head is slightly raised</li>\n<li>his muzzle is somewhat open, and you can see a little bit of his tongue</li>\n<li>his tail is lowered and relaxed</li>\n<li>his ears are positioned slightly to the front side of his head</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alert Dog Body Language</h2>\n<p>These are the features of an alert dog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>his head is raised and somewhat tilted forward</li>\n<li>his weight is slightly shifted forward</li>\n<li>his ears are turned forward</li>\n<li>his eyes are open and attentive</li>\n<li>his muzzle is closed </li>\n<li>his tail is relatively parallel to the ground and moves side to side</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Playful Dog Body Language</h2>\n<p>These are the features of a playful dog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>typical gesture for playfulness is the lowered front part of the body, where the front legs almost completely touch the ground</li>\n<li>his tail is broadly moving and is held up high</li>\n<li>his ears are up and to the front</li>\n<li>his eyes are wide open</li>\n<li>his muzzle is open, and his tongue is well visible</li>\n<li>your dog can let out a high pitched bark to round the entire invitation to play up</li>\n<li>during play the dog will change body postures quickly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Imposing Dog Body Language</h2>\n<p>There are several ways a dog is imposing: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>marking</li>\n<li>humping</li>\n<li>putting his paws on top of the other dog/human</li>\n<li>t-positioning</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But in addition to the features mentioned above, a dog can also use the following body language to impose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>he is standing stiff on his all four legs</li>\n<li>he is raising his head and pushing his chest forward and up as well with the intention to make himself look bigger</li>\n<li>his tail is up, wagging slowly from one side to the other</li>\n<li>his ears show forward</li>\n<li>his eyes might be averting from his opponent since imposing doesn’t always have to be of an aggressive nature</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Offensive Threatening Dog Body Language</h2>\n<p>The attitude in the offensive threat is similar to the imposing body posture.</p>\n<p>These are the features of an offensive threatening dog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the dog stands stiff-legged and slightly tilted forward</li>\n<li>his head is slightly lowered, so that head and back form a line</li>\n<li>the facial expression is characterised by short, rounded mouth angles, which are raised towards the front</li>\n<li>the ears are directed forward, and the opponent is possibly also fixed growling</li>\n<li>his neck whithers are raised</li>\n<li>his tail is raised above the backline, the tail hairs may also be raised</li>\n<li>the tail is stiff, but it can also vibrate slightly</li>\n<li>shortly before an attack, a snarling may occur</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The more insecure the dog is in this situation, the longer the mouth angles are pulled backwards. </p>\n<h2>Defensive Threatening Dog Body Language</h2>\n<p>Another dog can respond to an offensive threat with a defensive threat.\nThese are the features of a defensive threatening dog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the dog’s hind legs are slightly bent, aiming for a shrinking of the body</li>\n<li>his tail is lowered and pinched between his hind legs</li>\n<li>he is putting the ears back</li>\n<li>the corners of the mouth are pulled back long and pointed</li>\n<li>the teeth are bared over the entire mouth area, that much that the molars and gums are also visible</li>\n<li>he is biting in the air</li>\n<li>the dog can even scream, growl or bark.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Submissive Dog Body Language</h2>\n<p>Submission is when a lower-ranking animal submits to a higher ranking one. </p>\n<p>These are the features of a submissive dog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the dog is making himself smaller</li>\n<li>he is lowering his head to the ground, beginning to crawl or lying on its back</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This behaviour can dampen the aggression of other dogs, as the reduced, infantile body posture of the dog makes the other dog understand that no danger emanates from him. </p>\n<p>However, the opponent may also feel so disturbed by the mere presence of the other dog that submissive behaviour is not sufficient to stop the aggression.</p>\n<h3>Active Submissive Dog Body Language</h3>\n<p>The active submission starts from the submissive animal itself. </p>\n<p>The lower-ranking dog is also tense, but approaches the higher ranking dog and tries to calm him down actively by licking the corners of his mouth or lifting his paw to calm him down. </p>\n<p>Eye contact is not avoided - as in passive submission - but short and indirect eye contacts are made. The dog reduces his height. </p>\n<h3>Passive Submissive Dog Body Language</h3>\n<p>In this case, the other dog submits completely, lies on its back and does not dare to move in the slightest. </p>\n<p>The dog in this position behaves completely calm, quiet and passive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"🍂Hiker Girl \n🐶Thor, the GSD and Belgian Malinois mix, is my soul dog\n📷Humble Photographer\n🤸‍♀️ Yogi\n🌠Stardust\n☕ 🍫🥑Lover\n\n"},"authorImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=566&h=566&q=50 566w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"authorSlug":"alexandra","authorName":"Alexandra"},"createdAt":"2020-10-25T12:00:45.409Z"}},{"node":{"updatedAt":"2020-10-11T10:00:42.182Z","postTitle":"Dog Posture Meaning - Dog Mouth Language","postSlug":"dog-posture-meaning-dog-mouth-language","postFeaturedImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEA8ADwAAD/2wBDAAMCAgMCAgMDAwMEAwMEBQgFBQQEBQoHBwYIDAoMDAsKCwsNDhIQDQ4RDgsLEBYQERMUFRUVDA8XGBYUGBIUFRT/2wBDAQMEBAUEBQkFBQkUDQsNFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBT/wAARCAAeABQDAREAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQgCBgcE/8QAKhAAAgEDAwMEAQUBAAAAAAAAAQIDBAURAAYSByFBEzFRcWEIFiIygYL/xAAaAQACAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBgIDBQEH/8QAJxEAAQMCBAUFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACAxESBCExQRMiUWGhFBXB0fD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AGgp49uuwhi3FSKWHvIB2xj3JGiPXQuNQ/yhxC4ClEVttv24jcqjc1ukGcE5X5xqLsdGBk7ypCCpzCnV3zatBKIkv8Mi4DAwIXXH2Bqv3KEauXThzslt3P1LtmztuLWyQGaeSST0qd2xzOSQzHwp8H4OvO4RLNIGDRSa8lzR1VTvPWh7Dt9q2ey1K1juhNMycPSSRwMk+MLnHz499Hswckj7K9c1dbKCQ5pHdXfb10r73a461mSnMrMRGAMKM9h/nt9g6zyXMNCUJxSd0v2+9x+r61RzljiaqDtMpyYEyOCqCfCj2B8jWtCLeZBteQ8EHdAetHVgVXVuK0tcWuFveqdqnjSxxStEWAhiOMEBRj4J5H71pxRWwcUbjLNNuJlvfwvj9omA2ZV1G5rO0yzmhWCVoFp4o0IRezJ/bvni6n85z50sTQNa/nzKWRcKtposD31cJf2slYzuiNJTRemjZIEsbM2CfwGH/WtGtCR3+1CJlXiq7v1MW2W6XOOsjWlgNsuE6c1jIlqFLry5Nnt/JCQPGffv2NwhrEIzonTGuBcCBmtN6ezzRWSRUkODIrFwAC5MUZJbse/fH0BoOd3PUJIlNzyV/9k=","aspectRatio":0.6671875,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4I6ogEAtNE0et6r5UBSbiW/833ec1835630bdf2788cd223bfeb5be6/_DSC6881.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4I6ogEAtNE0et6r5UBSbiW/833ec1835630bdf2788cd223bfeb5be6/_DSC6881.jpeg?w=200&h=300&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4I6ogEAtNE0et6r5UBSbiW/833ec1835630bdf2788cd223bfeb5be6/_DSC6881.jpeg?w=400&h=600&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4I6ogEAtNE0et6r5UBSbiW/833ec1835630bdf2788cd223bfeb5be6/_DSC6881.jpeg?w=800&h=1199&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4I6ogEAtNE0et6r5UBSbiW/833ec1835630bdf2788cd223bfeb5be6/_DSC6881.jpeg?w=854&h=1280&q=50 854w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"postDescription":{"postDescription":"Have you ever asked yourself how dog communicate?

"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The eyes are the only sense organs with which something can be recorded as well as transmitted. </p>\n<p>Dog eyes naturally react very strongly to movement. They are almost fixated on things that move. </p>\n<p>In a dense blanket of leaves in the forest, your dog does not perceive each leaf as we do. For him, the whole thing actually seems more like a surface. But he registers every little movement within this surface.</p>\n<p>The fact that a dog is so strongly fixated on movement tells me that in training, it is always necessary to work with body language signals such as hand signals. </p>\n<p>The dog has a much wider field of vision than humans: 270° compared to 200° in humans. Therefore dogs can detect the slightest movement in an extensive area. </p>\n<p>Dogs are worse at estimating distances correctly. This is related to the overlap degree between the individual fields of vision: 60° for dogs and 120° for humans. Humans can also switch better between near and far vision than dogs, thanks to having a bigger lens build in. :-)</p>\n<p>A dog is not on the same eye level as a human being. This means that dogs, due to their lower body height, cannot see their surroundings as well as we humans can. </p>\n<p>The person behind the hedge can only be seen by the dog after he has passed the hedge. You, as the person walking with your dog, should be aware of such situations. In such sudden encounters, the dog can get scared, frightened and/or react aggressively.</p>\n<p>With their eyes, dogs can indicate almost all moods. They are an essential part of facial expressions. </p>\n<p>A dog’s gaze can be stiff, rigid, threatening, warm, demanding, fixating or fearful, to name just a few examples. The eyes can change size becoming bigger or smaller. Besides, each dog has a very individual eye shape, so there are dogs with round and dogs with almond-shaped eyes.</p>\n<h2>Dog Eye Language - Dog Facial Expressions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If a dog is in an aggressive mood, it pulls the eyebrow region together, downwards against the bridge of the nose. </li>\n<li>If a dog is frightened or submissive, it pulls it upwards against the temples.</li>\n<li>If a dog sees something exciting or frightening, his pupils dilate. Same also happens if a dog is happy. </li>\n<li>If a dog is tired or sleepy, then his pupils will get smaller.</li>\n<li>If a dog directs his gaze directly and for a long time at another dog, this is to be understood as a sign of provocation or threat.</li>\n<li>Submissiveness, restraint, peace seeker are signalled with an averted gaze, which can also be supported by blinking.</li>\n<li>For the subordinate members of the pack, it is essential to continually observe higher ranking animals to check out their mood. This attentive look is only of short duration.</li>\n<li>A gaze that lasts longer than two seconds can be dominant or a sign of a self-assured threat, This action is also backed up by threatening signals displayed by the rest of the body.</li>\n<li>If a dog stares at a human being, he sometimes does so only out of pure interest, out of joy, out of anxious expectation, because we might just be telling him something. Look at the big picture and context of the situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dog Posture Meaning - Dog Forehead Body Language</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Frowning is a signal of aggression or insecurity. Please notice the rest of your dog’s body language. See the context, see the big picture. </li>\n<li>If a dog shows submissiveness, it pulls its forehead very smoothly with its ears backwards, the eyes appear large and round, the ears are laid back.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What Colours Can Dogs See?</h2>\n<p>Since dogs and their ancestors are most active at dawn and dusk, e.g. in search of prey, the eye performance of day-active humans differs considerably from theirs. </p>\n<p>The cones inside our eyes are responsible for the colour vision. Humans have three different cone types for the colours red, green and blue. The brain then forms the overall colour impression of the colour information from the cones. </p>\n<p>Dogs, however, only have two different types of cones, they lack cones for the colour red. Therefore the dog cannot recognise the colour red. </p>\n<p>The dog’s colour vision is therefore roughly comparable to that of a person with red-green blindness. This information should be explicitly used in training. </p>\n<p>For example, if the dog is to use its nose when it is supposed to look for a ball in a meadow, it makes sense to choose a red ball. The dog can hardly make out this ball in the green field with his eyes. </p>\n<p>If, however, your dog needs to find the ball quickly, it is better to choose a blue ball, as he can immediately perceive it as a blue point in the green field.</p>\n<h2>Can Dogs See In The Dark?</h2>\n<p>Dogs have a light-reflecting layer on the back of their eyes, called <em>tapetum lucidum</em>. Because of the reflection, the light falls a second time on the cones inside the dog’s eyes, which is why he can see better in the dark than humans.</p>\n<p>In principle, the dog’s eyes do not function significantly different from those of humans. Light enters through the pupil and is directed by the lens onto the retina.

"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Even though dogs perceive the environment to a large extent with their nose, communication among dogs and between dogs and humans consists of a considerable degree of visual and tactile signals.</p>\n<h2>Do Dogs Have A Language?</h2>\n<p>A dog has many faces. He uses the different positions of eyes, ears, lips, forehead and head to communicate.</p>\n<p>Compared to body language, facial expressions change much faster. Therefore it is also more challenging to interpret the facial expressions of a dog. A small, short glance in another direction can mean a lot. Dogs would never overlook these signals.</p>\n<p>Visual communication, in particular, plays a vital role in initial contact because the first impression often determines the further course of an encounter. And even if the tactile signals are usually only used at the very end, i.e. after the dogs have perceived each other visually, olfactory and possibly also auditory, they are still of great importance in dog language.</p>\n<p>Breed diversity plays a significant role in facial communication. If my German shepherd mix is showing his teeth, every other breed can see it and recognise this. If a Bobtail does it, it is almost not visible due to his long facial and muzzle hairs. On the other side is the Mops that seems to be showing teeth 24/7. </p>\n<p>Dogs must, therefore, learn about the different breeds and their expressions already in the puppyhood. </p>\n<h2>How Do Dogs Communicate With Humans</h2>\n<p>It is essential that people know and recognise the sometimes minimal visual signals of dogs and that they know which tactile stimuli dogs like or dislike.</p>\n<p>Read this blog to learn how your dog is communicating with you and with other humans and dogs.</p>\n<h2>How Do Dogs Communicate With Each Other</h2>\n<p>If two dogs do not get along with each other, it is quickly decided whether an aggressive physical confrontation can no longer be avoided. </p>\n<p>If two dogs meet and like each other, after the first exchange of visual, olfactory or auditory signals, a wild, body-accentuated game may begin.

Objects, sounds, animals, people, etc. </li>\n<li>Why is your dog barking?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I also noticed many people frequently ask questions about <strong>why dogs bark</strong>, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why do dogs bark at night?</li>\n<li>Why do dogs bark at other dogs?</li>\n<li>Why do dogs bark at certain people?</li>\n<li>Why do dogs bark at the door?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read on to find out more about the reasons mentioned above and to answer your questions about why dogs bark. </p>\n<h2>Territorial Barking</h2>\n<p>Your dog's territory is not limited to your home, car and garden. It extends to the places where your dogs spend a lot of time. So for example, if you walk daily to the nearby park, at some extent your dog considers the parts of the park to be his territory.  </p>\n<p>Your dog can start barking excessively at people, animals, another dog especially, that enter or get close to his territory. </p>\n<p>If your dog lives in a big yard, he can fall into the patrolling behaviour barking at anything and everything that approaches his yard. </p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent your dog from taking the patrolling officer behaviour.</li>\n<li>If you have a large garden, there is no need for your dog to have access everywhere, thus limit his territory. </li>\n<li>Don't allow your dog to say hi to people at the front door, at the front gate or through the fence.</li>\n<li>Teach the command \"quiet\". This is not as simple as this sentence, but nonetheless super effective if you teach it to your dog. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alarm Barking</h2>\n<p>The alarm barking can be abrupt and startling, and it takes place when your dog senses a threat in the vicinity of your/his home/area.</p>\n<p>Ignoring the alarm barking may lead to persistent and continuous barking, as your dog is trying to inform you about the situation, but no one is listening. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, alarm barking might change to territorial barking. If you are not reacting to the alarm bark, then your dog might take on the assignment to protect the home. </p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't ignore your dog's bark. </li>\n<li>Say thank you and go check it out. Be assertive and in control. That shows your dog you are in control of the situation and he doesn't need to start his defence protocols. </li>\n<li>Teach the command \"quiet\". This is not as simple as this sentence, but nonetheless super effective if you teach it to your dog. </li>\n<li>Teach your dog to \"go on his spot\". Very useful if someone is actually at the door. Like a mailman or neighbour.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Attention-Seeking Barking</h2>\n<p>Most dogs crave attention. Here is an example of attention barking behaviour.</p>\n<p>Imagine you work on your computer or watch TV, and you ignore your dog. A dog that doesn't have a balanced life (play, attention, cuddle, food, water, workout, walks) will seek your attention to fulfil whatever he is still in need for. </p>\n<p>Some forms of attention-seeking are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>your dog brings you his toy and sits near you with it or puts it in your lap</li>\n<li>your dog is pawing you</li>\n<li>your dog is pushing you with his nose</li>\n<li>your dog is licking you</li>\n<li>your dog is running around you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the above mentioned quiet behaviours are ignored, your dog will bark.\nAs soon as you gave your dog attention when he barked, your dog will memorise that bark = attention.  </p>\n<p>Your smart dog has found <em>the</em> way to distract you from whatever you are doing. Any form of attention you give him at that point is a reinforcement for attention-seeking, even negative attention, is a reward.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't reward your dog for barking at you in this situation.</li>\n<li>Make sure your dog's needs are met. Workout, training, mind training as well.</li>\n<li>Regularly seek your dog and give him attention, not when he is annoying for, but when he is in a calm state. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Greeting Barking</h2>\n<p>This is a joyful bark accompanied by whining, tail wagging and other signs of friendliness. Your dog most likely barks the same way when family members come home as well. </p>\n<p>Overdoing it can lead to having a dog that jumps on family members, on you, on visitors. </p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep greetings low key. Explain to your visit and ask them to stay calm and ignore your dog. Nothing is worse in this situation than an auntie with high pitched voice and baby talk running to your dog for kisses. </li>\n<li>Teach your dog to hold his toy before you let visit in. Not going to work in some dogs, since the excitement over the people is higher than the toy. </li>\n<li>Teach your dog to ignore walkers, bikers, joggers, cars, etc. When someone wants to pass, call you dog to heel and pass the person calmly. Honestly, I love dog dogs, but I find it unnecessary for any dog to come and jump on me. Also, keep in mind some people are afraid of dogs. </li>\n<li>Change your doorbell ring tone. As silly as it sounds, your dog gets conditioned, and that sounds = excitement. Try another ring tone and give the new tone another meaning, e.g. new doorbell sound = yummy chicken. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Compulsive Barking</h2>\n<p>Compulsive barking is a repetitive barking held over a long period. If you observe your dog, you will notice that he is not alarmed, but shows repeated behaviours like spinning, circling or jumping while barking. </p>\n<p>The barking is focused towards well apparently nothing and everything from staring at the sky, fence or mirror to lights, shadows or doors. </p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Find the source and never leave it for too long because it will only become harder to undo the behaviour.</li>\n<li>Go for a check-up at the vet to rule out any physiological issues.</li>\n<li>Be patient and do not yell at your dog. It will only agitate your dog even more, and his barking becomes now justified. </li>\n<li>Divert his attention either with games, training (nothing too complicated) or go for a walk or run. </li>\n<li>Seek help from a dog behaviourist. Note that not every dog trainer is suited for your dog's issue. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Socially Facilitated Barking</h2>\n<p>Sometimes your dog barks just because of other dogs barking. This is not every dog. Please remember every dog is unique in their likes and dislikes. </p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your dog indoors. </li>\n<li>Turn the music or tv on.</li>\n<li>Turn your dog's attention from another dog on you for play and training. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Frustration-Induced Barking</h2>\n<p>Did your dog ever pushed his toy in a corner or under the sofa and he was not able to get it? Did he bark? I know Thor does. He would look under the couch where his ball rolled and bark at it. </p>\n<p>Another example is I try to set up games for Thor that make him think. So I showed him his ball and put it into a huge carton box. After a couple of seconds that he wasn't able to get it, he started barking out of frustration.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Teach your dog patience. Best way to do it is to attend obedience classes that will help him control his impulses. </li>\n<li>Discourage excitement and make your dog wait before going on, getting his favourite toy or his dinner. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Illness or Injury</h2>\n<p>A senior dog may bark in a repetitive, monotonous manner, for no particular reason. </p>\n<p>A dog with dementia will get lost in familiar places, may not recognise their owner, or fail to follow basic, previously known, commands. </p>\n<p>This situation is frightening for the dog, and he might be barking because he is confused. </p>\n<p>Your dog can also bark if he has an injury and something or someone touches that tender spot.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Consult your vet immediately. </li>\n<li>Get to terms with the fact that your dog is old. Old is not bad, it is just a state. Be in the moment. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Boredom Barking</h2>\n<p>The word boredom says it all: your dog is bored and he chooses to bark as an outlet. Is like with some humans that go for the chips bag ( guilty as charged here :-)).</p>\n<p>It is similar to the attention-seeking bark, but most of the times this occurs when your dog is left alone at home. </p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Play regularly with your dog mind stimulating games, e.g. the search for food or toys. </li>\n<li>Train and workout regularly. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Separation-Anxiety Barking</h2>\n<p>This condition sets your dog in a high state of stress which leads to destructive behaviour and excessive barking, putting you at the bottom on your neighbour's Like List. </p>\n<p>Some dogs enter a state of panic and seek to be reunited with the owner.</p>\n<p>Characteristic behaviour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scratching and chewing at the windows and doors</li>\n<li>Urination and defecation</li>\n<li>Pacing, lack of calmness </li>\n<li>Excessive drooling</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Play regularly with your dog mind stimulating games, e.g. the search for food or toys. </li>\n<li>Train and workout regularly. </li>\n<li>Refrain from saying goodbye when you leave the house.</li>\n<li>Most dog's need to smell their owner's scent, so place a sweated shirt wherever your dog sleeps. My dog spends his 5h alone at home in our bed. Now I know this is not for everybody, but this is ok for us and works fine for him. </li>\n<li>Seek help from a dog behaviourist. Note that not every dog trainer is suited for your dog's issue. Some dog owners just give up and give their dog up for adoption, but separation anxiety can be worked on. No need to bail out. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fearful Barking</h2>\n<p>Most people confuse (especially if it is a bigger dog breed) this type of barking with aggressive dog behaviour. </p>\n<p>Characteristic behaviour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flattened ears</li>\n<li>Corner of the mouth pulled back</li>\n<li>Whites of the eyes showing</li>\n<li>Hackles and/or tail might be up. </li>\n<li>Nervous pacing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fearful barking is used as a distance-increasing signal, and it is high pitched and repetitive. Your dog wants for the trigger to go away. </p>\n<p>When your dog is fearful and barking, he may run back and forth, and if he is on the leash, maybe he will be zig-zagging. </p>\n<p>Fear barking may be triggered by sights (dog sees another dog or jogger), sounds (dog hears the sound of the dog tags of another dog), and even smells. Sudden movements of a person or prolonged eye contact from a stranger can be the cause of a sudden plunge forward and barking. </p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>See the context and identify the trigger. Work on desensitisation and reconditioning. </li>\n<li>Give your dog the space he needs, do not force him into situations you know he will fail. Set him up for success. </li>\n<li>Train obedience.</li>\n<li>Learn your dog's behaviour and prevent outbursts.\n* Notice what strangers do, e.g. in case of a prolonged eye contact turn around with your dog and walk a couple of meters in the same direction. That will break the staring contest, and you shift your dog's attention on you.\n* Increase the distance to another dog if that is his trigger. Turn around, go on the other sidewalk. I know it is frustrating, but it will get better with time and training. </li>\n<li>Pay attention to your environment. Try to spot the trigger before your dog does. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Where you able to answer the 4 key questions?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When and where does your dog bark?</li>\n<li>Who or what is the target of your dog's bark?</li>\n<li>What triggers your dog's barking? Objects, sounds, animals, people, etc. </li>\n<li>Why is your dog barking?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A couple of tips before you go:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look at the context and trust your gut. YOU know your dog. Pay attention to him and seek professional help. Please assess how professional this help is beforehand. I went through painfully 5 dog trainers. Made a million mistakes and worked hard with my dog for 2 years to correct them. </li>\n<li>Experiment and try new ways to see if they work for you and your dog. </li>\n<li>Educate yourself about dog behaviour. Do not expect others to fix your dog. </li>\n<li>Use positive reinforcement. </li>\n<li>Do you REALLY have a problem? Do you see people yelling at their horses for whining, or their cats for meowing, or their cow for mooing? Dog bark. Is it excessive, or is it just healthy communication?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why Do Dogs Bark - FAQ</h2>\n<h3>Why Do Dogs Bark At Other Dogs?</h3>\n<p>Honestly, I can not say exactly, because it is all about context and body language. If I am not there to see, I can not tell. </p>\n<p>Reasons could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to say hello</li>\n<li>to tell the other dog to go away </li>\n<li>guarding the owner </li>\n<li>guarding/warning other pack members</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why Do Dogs Bark At Strangers</h2>\n<p>Some dog trainers, blogs, etc. say that if your dog is socialised enough, he will be happy among all people no matter who they are and what they are doing. </p>\n<p>My opinion: bullshit. There I cursed, and I am not going to delete it. </p>\n<p>Let me ask you: do you like everyone you have ever met and will like everyone you will ever meet? I would say no. I don’t say you hate people, I just say you will not go for coffee with everybody you have ever met or will ever meet. </p>\n<p>You have your preferences, and so does your dog. Sure, your dog can be unfamiliar with Eskimos (nothing against them, just the first distinctive people that occurred to me). That means nothing, though. Your dog is not a racist. He will prefer some people over others, regardless of their colour and where they come from. </p>\n<p>If your dog doesn’t like someone, again context is vital, then he will say so. You see, they are honest like that. </p>\n<h2>Nervous Dog Barking At Visitors</h2>\n<p>Re-read the section about greeting barking. At the end of the day, dogs are animals. They have their territories, and they ring the alarm. It is what happens after the alarm is given is important, and how you behave when the alarm goes. Calm and assertive are key here.</p>\n<h2>Why Do Dogs Bark At Night</h2>\n<p>Where do you live? </p>\n<p>Do you live in a flat, that is quiet after 10pm and any noise in the middle of the night is considered unusual? My dog barked because someone was trying to steal my bike, so thanks to him, I still have it :-).</p>\n<p>Do you live in a place where nocturnal animals come out and are active? Your dog smells them from miles away, so he is ringing the alarm / being territorial. </p>\n<h2>Why Do Dogs Bark - The Things You Don’t Do</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t put a shock collar on your dog</li>\n<li>Don’t spray your dog in the nose with lemon </li>\n<li>Don’t yell at your dog</li>\n<li>Don’t hit your dog</li>\n<li>Don’t lock your dog up in the kennel or a room or outside</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"🍂Hiker Girl \n🐶Thor, the GSD and Belgian Malinois mix, is my soul dog\n📷Humble Photographer\n🤸‍♀️ Yogi\n🌠Stardust\n☕ 🍫🥑Lover\n\n"},"authorImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=200&h=200&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=400&h=400&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1wlD5ooYhDPyiRWwx8pPrI/f3d4e0fd11f8b8af3c728979e3d1beb7/IMG_4182.jpeg?w=566&h=566&q=50 566w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"authorSlug":"alexandra","authorName":"Alexandra"},"createdAt":"2020-08-22T11:00:51.408Z"}}]},"contentfulCategories":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care","categoryDescription":{"categoryDescription":"All you need to know about how to best care for your dog from puppyhood to your dog's senior years.
