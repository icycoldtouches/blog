Don't make it to long"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Raising and guiding this little soul starts as soon as your puppy enters the house. Before you bring your puppy home you should have thought about what your puppy is allowed to do, what the house rules are and so on.</p>\n<p>If you planned all the details out correctly you are completely ready to receive the puppy and set your puppy and yourself up for a good start. In this article, I focus on the first week of your puppy in your home and the things you should take into consideration.</p>\n<h2>Getting your puppy from the breeder</h2>\n<p>It is time to pick up your puppy at the breeder. </p>\n<p>But when is the best time to do this? In the evening after work? Early in the morning? Or in your lunch break? </p>\n<p>Picking up the puppy is best done in the morning or right before noon.</p>\n<p>This way the puppy has a large part of the day to get used to your house before you go to bed. </p>\n<p>Not every breeder lives around the corner, sometimes you might need to drive a few hours to get your puppy.</p>\n<p>When you have to drive a long way its best you take a family member or a friend. </p>\n<p>This way one person can focus on driving while the other holds the new puppy in their lap. </p>\n<p>Offering safety and care during driving will help your new puppy to get used to the car. </p>\n<p>The puppy will have a positive experience which will help him get used to the car for the future.</p>\n<p>If the breeder has taken the puppies into the car several times, to visit the vet for example, there will probably be no motion sickness. But be prepared in case the puppy will drool excessively or even puke.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that for the first time in its life your new puppy is going to be alone, without his brothers, sisters or his/her mum. </p>\n<p>This means it will be confused and scared and fearful. </p>\n<p>Try to offer protection and comfort as much as possible.</p>\n<h2>Bringing your new puppy into your home</h2>\n<p>Before you bring your new puppy into your house, it is important that your house is puppy proof and that you have the following essential items at home:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Food + Water Bowls</li>\n<li>Toys</li>\n<li>Collar + Leash</li>\n<li>Crate</li>\n<li>A Comfortable Basket or Pillow</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you arrive in front of the door, it is time to open the door and put your new puppy on the ground. </p>\n<p>Give your puppy some space after arrival to discover the living room and other rooms he is allowed in.</p>\n<p>You can even sit comfortably on the floor with the puppy so that you are a safe spot for the puppy to come back to.</p>\n<p>Put a few toys on the floor so that there are things that your puppy can get interested in and start playing with. </p>\n<p>If your puppy comes to sit or hide with you, give the puppy your attention and affection. In this way, the puppy will gather lots of positive experiences with and from you.</p>\n<h2>What if you already have one or more dog(s)?</h2>\n<p>If you have several dogs, it is advisable that, before you arrive home, you look for a place where you can walk around safely with your dog(s) and puppy.</p>\n<p>No traffic, no other dogs, just you, the person assisting you on this day, your own dog(s) and your puppy. </p>\n<p>This way they can first get acquainted on neutral territory. First, hold your puppy in your arms and let the adult dog(s) sniff carefully.</p>\n<p>When both parties are relaxed, you can put your puppy between your legs.</p>\n<p>A short walk ensures that the adult dog(s) and your puppy can be close to each other in a relaxed way and can discover odors. </p>\n<p>It is nice when an extra person is present that can help you, so that you can fully concentrate on your puppy.</p>\n<h2>Develop a routine for your new puppy</h2>\n<p>The best thing is to take a vacation when your puppy comes home. But despite being free, it is important to immediately develop a routine, preferably one that is also useful when you return to work.</p>\n<p>This routine is best put together when your puppy is still with the breeder. The moment that your puppy arrives, you are going to implement it.</p>\n<p>Your puppy will have to pee after an hour, or perhaps earlier. Take your puppy into the garden or to a quiet spot in the park or the street. </p>\n<p>After the puppy did his pees and poops, you reward the action with some yummy food and you go back inside again.</p>\n<p>Because the puppy is really getting used to the new environment in the first few hours, you don’t want to rush things right away. </p>\n<p>Feel free to make a cup of coffee, fold the laundry, or check your email. Keep an eye on your puppy though! </p>\n<p>Puppies can be curious and get themselves in trouble in no time.</p>\n<p>Give it some time and the little fluffy soul will probably stay with you like your small shadow because you will be a familiar sight and smell.</p>\n<p>Try to introduce the routine slowly in the upcoming days. That way your puppy actually grows in that routine and it will become very normal.</p>\n<p>Stick to a routine that you would also do when you go back to work. Wake up early, go for the morning walk. </p>\n<p>Implement quiet times and training sessions throughout the day. </p>\n<p>Puppies need to go to potty in much shorter intervals of time as adult dogs. That means that you need to know and be prepared for this.</p>\n<p>After a few days, you can start quietly close a door and come back after a few seconds. Your puppy learns that closed doors are a part of life and not a cause for panic.</p>\n<h2>How to Potty Train Your 8 Weeks Old Puppy</h2>\n<p>What is the best way to get started with potty training?</p>\n<p>When you come home with your puppy, after you have picked him up from the breeder, you can immediately start with a permanent spot in the garden, apartment or balcony. </p>\n<p>Just wait and see if the puppy will pee and you can reward with food, toy, voice and / or attention.</p>\n<p>By using this spot immediately your puppy will learn where he can go when he has to pee and he will walk to it when he has to pee.</p>\n<p>This does take some time, it is not learned in a day. If you have a garden, it is useful if you teach a permanent place in that garden where the puppy is allowed to do his business. </p>\n<p>You can take your puppy on the arm or on a leash to this place to have him pee or poop there.</p>\n<p>This saves you a lot of yellow spots on your lawn.</p>\n<p>For in the middle of the night, this is also a nice solution because puppies can be insecure in the dark. After a few days, the environment is known and it feels like a safe for the puppy to wonder.</p>\n<p>If you do not have a garden or you absolutely do not want your puppy to ever pee or poop in the garden, you can choose a spot outside in a park or park.</p>\n<p>Choose a place that is not very busy, and were not too much is happening at the same time. In the middle of the park can be very intimidating, especially when other people and dogs walk there.</p>\n<p>The stimulation from the environment can then ensure that your puppy is distracted and forgets that he has to pee and/or poop. </p>\n<p>By looking for a permanent place every time during the first few weeks, the pup learn through association that pee and poop is done at that place.</p>\n<p>To make your message clear that peeing and pooping are appreciated at the designated places, you can reward with a calm voice and good food.</p>\n<p>Most important is to enjoy, have fun and socialise your puppy as much as possible to enable a balanced and well behaved grown up doggy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!

Don't make it to long"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The best story that comes to my mind when thinking about bonding with your dog is the well know-known and filmed story of Hachiko, the Japanese Akita that awaited for his human, Professor Ueno, everyday.</p>\n<p>In 1924, the Japanese professor Ueno would each morning say goodbye to his dog Hachiko then walk to the train station and go to work. At three o’clock, Ueno would return home to find Hachiko sitting by the tracks, waiting for him. Every day for over a year Hachiko would be there, waiting.</p>\n<p>On a day in May of 1925, Hachiko walked as usual down to the station to wait for Ueno’s return. But, sadly, the professor had died at his school that day and he would never again return to his faithful Hachiko.</p>\n<p>Though given to another family, Hachiko escaped each day and returned to the professor’s home in hopes of finding him. When this failed, the dog began the old ritual again, arriving each day at the station at precisely three o’clock, to wait. Hachiko did this every day for the next ten years until his death. </p>\n<p>I bet most of us, dog owners, dream of a bond like that. But how can this be achieved?</p>\n<h2>The Difference Between Relationship And Bond</h2>\n<p>Relationships form fast and are many, they are build easier. Bonds need time to develop and happen only with chosen partners. Before the age of 14 weeks the puppy finds all humans interesting and he is curious about everybody. At this stage in life there is no bonding happening that is why it is ok to allow other humans to take care of him. After the ager of 14 weeks the bonding process can begin. It is recommended to allow your dog to bond with someone else too in case you need to go on a business trip, or you are sick, so that the dog doesn’t suffer too much when you are away.</p>\n<h2>What Hinders You From Bonding With Your Dog?</h2>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4lh6kS72PabCwjfugqQdJt/a0b3aa3c06a5b7a74bbd3c265431e07b/_MG_0651.jpeg\" alt=\"what hinders you from bonding with your dog\" class=\"post__content--image-full\"/>\n<h3>High Expectations</h3>\n<p>You choose your dog, he has no saying in whether he wants you or not.</p>\n<p>And on top of that some of us have a “clear” image of what this dog should do and don’t do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be nice to people</li>\n<li>Be nice to other dogs</li>\n<li>Don’t bark</li>\n<li>Don’t howl</li>\n<li>etc, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the dog is given a list of does and don’ts in our head and if he doesn’t perform accordingly he is punished or yelled at and the worse of all we blame the dog for the failure instead of looking what we did wrong in the communication.</p>\n<p>How is this fair to the dog?</p>\n<h3>Misconception</h3>\n<p>One misconception is mistaking training and education with bonding. These are 3 different things.</p>\n<p>Training is you teaching your dog behaviours and postures and words associated with these. There is no need to be a drill sergeant and yell every command to him. He can hear just fine and being friendly when you ask him to do things will make it more desirable for the dog to work for and with you.</p>\n<p>Education is showing the dog what the rules and boundaries are. Is he allowed on the couch, is he allowed on the bed, who enters the door first, etc.</p>\n<p>Bonding is not training nor education. Bonding is much more than that.</p>\n<h3>Miscommunication</h3>\n<p>Humans mainly communicate verbally while dogs mainly communicate non-verbally, through body language.</p>\n<p>Do you see the gap? If you don’t learn to body language of your dog and if you only yell 101 commands to him, then you are setting yourself and your dog up for failure.</p>\n<h3>Protection</h3>\n<p>You offer little to no protection and help when your dog is overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>No dog will accept everyone’s touch and no dog will be friends with all the dogs he meets in his life. Be aware of this fact. Just like you don’t go for a coffee with everyone you meet or hug everybody you meet.</p>\n<p>Also you don’t offer your dog the protection he needs is when e.g. during dog play he is bullied and you don’t react and stop it. Dogs need from their human protection and if you fail to provide it, then he needs to provide it by himself and some dogs will start acting “aggressive”.</p>\n<h3>One Sided Contact</h3>\n<p>The contact is initiated only by your dog being for petting, food, playtime, doesn’t matter. This will decrease your chance of bonding and you will represent for the dog only a mean to a goal.</p>\n<p>This goes the other way as well. Are you the one always looking for contact with you dog? Make sure you respect when he needs his quiet moments and rest. Read his body language. Is he stretching and asking for more petting or is he turning away trying to tell you he needs his space?</p>\n<h3>Ignoring Eye Contact</h3>\n<p>Ohhh, this is a big one people! Missing out on this one will decrease your chance to bong from a distance with your dog.</p>\n<p>If your dog is looking at you while you are walking him, no matter if on leash or off leash, repay actively that awesome gift he is giving you because even being outside, where everything is exciting, he still is able to overcome those impulses and look at YOU.</p>\n<h2>How To Bond With Your Dog?</h2>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1k29Apqcs2LqTrOuRBNJ44/8e060068dc2927eb8f41a81339ecc065/_MG_4768.jpeg\" alt=\"how to bind with your dog\" class=\"post__content--image-full\"/>\n<h3>Understand The Dog’s Personality</h3>\n<p>Every dogs is different, just like every human is different. Every dog brings a personality to the relationship and actually this is what makes it awesome.</p>\n<p>Of course your life would be perfect if your dog would walk off leash all the by your side, loved all humans and all dogs. But perfect is boring in my opinion. Life is not perfect and how you respond to the imperfectness of life is what makes you grow and gives you the experience of life.</p>\n<p>My dog was bullied as puppy and I didn’t see it. I was blind to it and I was uneducated. The bullying caused him to become “aggressive” towards certain dogs and humans that have a certain energy. I know why is happening, I know what triggers him so I am helping him each time he is triggered to overcome the unsafe moment.</p>\n<p>Would I want to change him or give him away? NOT for all the money on the planet.</p>\n<h3>Understand The Dog’s Communication Language</h3>\n<p>The better you are at understanding your dog’s language the better your bond and relationship will be. Knowing how to communicate with your dog will improve your chances in correcting unwanted behavior. Remember that first you need to understand why a behavior is used in the first place.</p>\n<h3>Build Trust</h3>\n<p>Your dog should be able to trust you to e.g. not allow people to bend over him and pet him, if he doesn’t like that. That implies that you get to know your likes and dislikes of your dog.</p>\n<p>By impeding other people or dogs to get near your dog, you show your dog that he can trust you to offer protection. And this goes a very long way in building a bond with your dog.</p>\n<h2>What Activities Help Bonding With Your Dog?</h2>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/6jzs94VVBNYOGiMDGoSQxm/15b0f5a7182884593ac0bdbe51490d75/_MG_7440.png\" alt=\"activities to bound with your dog\" class=\"post__content--image-full\"/>\n<h3>Hiking</h3>\n<p>Spend a day or half a day checking out a new mountain, park, or nature-filled area with your dog and enjoy exploring the outdoors with him.</p>\n<p>Dogs love being outside, and if you want to bond with your dog, you should find as many ways to be outdoors with your dog as possible. Bring some dog-friendly food, and some regular food for you, and have a nice time bonding with your pet while enjoying a nice picnic on the trail.</p>\n<p>Make sure the hiking area allows dogs in advance, and that you have some water and treats on hand for your favorite creature. Also respect leash rules in that areas if there are any.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Advantages:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Going exploring with your dog can help strengthen your bond.</li>\n<li>As you hike together, pay attention to what your dog likes or dislikes. See if he prefers climbing up mountains, playing in wooded areas, or exploring the ground near water. Don’t make him do something he doesn’t want to do.</li>\n<li>Keeps you and your dog fit and healthy.</li>\n<li>Hide and Sniff</li>\n<li>You can show your dog his favorite toy, and then hide it in an easy-to-find location. He’ll love playing this game and will be rewarded with the toy once he finds it. You can tell him what a good boy he is for playing the game and for being so smart. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Play Outside</h3>\n<p>Use being outdoors to keep yourself and your dog fit. Play fetch or Frisbee. Make sure that before you start the high intensity play, your dog and you had a chance to warm up a bit.</p>\n<h3>Toy Picking</h3>\n<p>Sometimes I offer my dog the right to choose what toy he takes out on out hike/walk. I hold two of his favourite toys in my hands and allow him to grab which ever he likes.</p>\n<h3>Pet With Purpose</h3>\n<p>Instead of watching TV and petting your dog, try to give your attention to him while petting as well. Or maybe instead of petting you give him a well deserved massage.</p>\n<p>Though it may sound silly, just spending a couple of minutes once a week giving your dog a nice, relaxing massage can help deepen your bond. Massage him as you would a human — behind the ears, on the neck, on his back, and anywhere that seems to make him feel good. Start off gently and deepen your massages if your dog seems to like it. This will be a great way for you to physically connect with your dog.</p>\n<p>Every dog is different. Some like to be massaged, while some may wrangle out of your grasp. Get a feel for what your dog likes as you try this new bonding activity. If he just prefers to be petted, then don’t force it and stick to that.</p>\n<h2>Conculsion</h2>\n<p>My view of the dog-human bonding is that it is founded on love, trust, and understanding and not a relationship where one partner is submissive to the other.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!

Don't make it to long"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Your puppy will get tired of all the new experiences and incentives. If your puppy gets tired, it’s time to stop the activity that you are doing.</p>\n<p>The processing of stimuli is mainly done during sleep. To be able to dose properly your puppy’s training it is therefore important that you recognise the fatigue signals of your young dog.</p>\n<p>There are several things that you can see when a puppy gets tired. Mimic is one of them.\nIf you look at the face of your puppy, you can look at the eyes, ears and mouth.</p>\n<h2>The Mouth</h2>\n<p>When we start with the mouth then you can notice that a puppy is starting to get tired or starts getting warm because because of the panting. </p>\n<p>The mouth opens slightly with the corners of the mouth pulled slightly backwards.\nOn the mouth you can notice even more fatigue. The puppy will bite harder or more when he gets tired. All pups bite, but when a pup gets tired, the intensity and frequency can increase.</p>\n<h2>The Ears</h2>\n<p>You can also read a lot of information on the ears of your puppy. Tired puppies let their ears hang slightly on the side of their head.</p>\n<p>This happens with hanging ears as well as with standing ears. The ears then seem to hang a little ‘Half stick’.</p>\n<h2>The Eyes</h2>\n<p>Puppy’s eyes always provide information. When tired, the eyes may turn a little red.\nThe lower eyelids of the dogs that are looser in their skin can hang down a bit (especially with the larger breeds).</p>\n<p>The look of a puppy will change. When a puppy realises that he is tired and he is able to find its peace, you will see that it has half closed eyes.</p>\n<h2>Eye Bags</h2>\n<p>Another clear signal on your dog’s face is the appearance of “eye bags”. These bags are lines under the eyes that are about halfway between the eyes and the mouth.\nThese are veins that fill because the corners of the mouth are pulled slightly backwards. These lines form with fatigue, stress and heat.</p>\n<p>With a puppy you see these lines appear quite quickly when you play with him or when he is in a new environment.</p>\n<h2>The Crazy Five Minutes</h2>\n<p>Everyone knows this one. It is that moment when puppies and adult dogs start running in a frenetic manner. Many puppies also add a lot of biting and often they are not accountable for their behaviour at that time.</p>\n<p>There is usually a fixed period of time on the day in which this happens, and that is usually the end of the afternoon or the beginning of the evening. A whole day has already passed for the puppy: walked several times, did some exercises, played, chewed and maybe made a socialisation trip or had a visit.</p>\n<p>After such a full day, it may happen that your puppy is extremely tired, but is unable to realise that he should go to sleep.</p>\n<p>Or he does not have the peace to go to sleep because he is so busy in his head.\nThe puppy can then go wild and be frenetic running around the garden or from one room to another or chase his own tail. The crazy five minutes or the zoomies.\nAt the end of this crazy five minutes the puppy eventually falls asleep, but often it happens that the puppy in the middle of the game with someone in the house becomes too frenetic and starts biting too hard.</p>\n<p>The puppy is tired, stressed or super excited and as he shows, he is unable to calm himself in that situation. The best solution is, after the zoomies moment passed, is to ensure that your puppy is put in his bench or his bed for a while so that he can find the peace and quiet to sleep.</p>\n<p>In the bench or the bed you can put some safe toys that the pup can bite or chew on to get rid of the tension.\nIf no further attention is paid to the puppy, it usually falls asleep within a couple of minutes.</p>\n<h3>What To Do When You See One Of These Signals</h3>\n<p>If you see one or more of these signals, then your puppy is ready for a nap!\nIf the puppy does not get any moments of rest or if he cannot take a rest himself, it is important to give him structured rest moments.</p>\n<p>This can be achieved in a bench or in a room where there is little activity and external stimulation so that the puppy will fall asleep. </p>\n<p>If you continue to play when the puppy is already tired, then the game can degenerate and the chances are you end a game in a negative manner, enabling “bad” memories to the puppy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"🍂Hiker Girl \n🐶Thor, the GSD and

This is not the official ancestor of our dog, but it is closely related to the dog.</p>\n<h2>The Gray Wolf Social Characteristics</h2>\n<p>The gray wolf is a very social animal that likes to live in groups, also known as packs, although it sometimes happens that a wolf lives alone.\nThese wolf packs have a real family structure that consists of the parent animals and their offspring of different ages. In rare cases, it sometimes happens that wolves from outside are included in the pack, but normally the outside wolves are chased away and in the worst case even killed.</p>\n<p>The two-parent animals <strong>(father and mother)</strong> are the only ones who get couples and puppies. These puppies are raised by them and remain in the pack for many years, sometimes even their entire lives. The entire pack helps to raise the puppies and find food. If the young are old enough to find their own place <strong>(after a few years)</strong> or if there is not enough food for the whole family, they leave the pack voluntarily.\nWolf packs in the wild are harmonious and conflicts are much less common than ever thought. If there is less to eat, for example in the winter, then aggression is more common in a wolf pack.</p>\n<p>The classification of the rank in a pack of wolves consists of the parent animals at the top as the natural leader figures and the young puppies who follow. The youngest puppies are given priority to food until they are old enough to stand up for themselves and help with hunting. The young puppies show respect for their elderly because they depend on them for food and protection.</p>\n<p>Expressions of submissive behavior occur regularly. A common submissive behavior, also known as active submission, is most often observed when the group comes together again or before the group goes hunting.</p>\n<p>During active submission, the performing wolf keeps low to the ground, wags low with the tail and licks the lips of the recipient. This behavior is mainly performed by the younger wolves with the older wolves as a recipient but is also performed to a lesser extent by the older animals.</p>\n<p>Whether this behavior is considered submissive is not always clear and may depend on the context. The behavior can be interpreted as status recognition, but nowadays it is also recognized as a connection ritual with the aim of strengthening the relationship.\nAnother behavior that is also seen is that the wolf turns on its back, often after the intimidation of another wolf. This behavior is also called passive submission because in this case, the other wolf initiates it. This behavior is described as a submissive behavior and probably has the function of avoiding a conflict in which one wolf submits to another wolf.</p>\n<p>Many studies that have been conducted into wolf behavior have since become obsolete. These studies were based on wolf groups that were kept in the zoo. These wolves were often not related to each other, lived in a stressful or too small environment and therefore displayed much aggression towards each other. So conflicts occurred very regularly.</p>\n<p>Recent research into wild wolves found a social structure that had never been seen before.</p>\n<p>Our modern dog comes from a wolf that no longer exists. There is also a time of more than ten thousand years between the wolf and the dog, where behavior and appearance have changed enormously. The social characteristics that we see in our dog are therefore difficult to compare with the social characteristics of the modern wolf, although there are still many behaviors that we will recognize.\nTo find out our dog’s social structure, we will have to observe dogs in their natural environment. However, what is a natural environment for a dog? Our own living room? The local dog park? In the following sections, we describe the social structure as dogs would classify themselves, with little or no human influence, after which we compare this with our own domestic dog.</p>\n<h2>The Dingo’s Social Characteristics</h2>\n<p>In Australia lives a dog that ended up in the wild thousands of years ago. These dogs are completely wild today and are therefore a good example of how a dog would organize its own social structure. Dingo’s often just wandering around looking for food, though there are also large groups who hunt together.</p>\n<p>As far as we know, the bitches raise their youngsters themselves, taking distance from the group until the youngsters are big enough to stand up for themselves. Unfortunately, not much research has been done on dingos in the wild and studies of dingos in zoos are not a good example of the natural situation.</p>\n<p>Also, dingos are so wild that living together with people is very difficult. Dingos are very individual and do not bind well to people. They are also often seen as a burden that causes them to be driven away or killed by people.</p>\n<h2>The Pariah Dog Social Characteristics</h2>\n<p>The pariah dog is a real village dog and can be found in West Bengal. These dogs roam freely in villages and are tolerated by the residents. They live mainly from food waste, but also receive food from the residents. This structure is very similar to how the first dogs lived together with humans and is therefore also a good example of how a dog would classify its social structure alongside humans.</p>\n<p>In these villages, there are sometimes as many as one hundred dogs per village. The dogs are often seen in small family groups, as you see in wolves. Yet every dog lives much more by itself and each individual provides his own food. The dogs are very tolerant towards each other, although a group will defend its territory against unknown dogs.</p>\n<p>Different groups can live close to each other and despite the fact that the territory is being defended, real fights with potentially fatal consequences are rare. Regarding mating behavior, these dogs are very different from how you would see that with wolves. When a bitch is in heat, she mates with different males, who often enter into conflicts with each other to get to the bitch. After heat, one of the males may stay with her until the puppies are born, but the puppies are only raised by the mother. Also when they are older the puppies no longer stay with the mother to help with the upbringing, but they go their own way.</p>\n<p>There is virtually no mention of a structured ranking in a group of pariah dogs. There is no alpha pair or a dominant leader, although it has been observed that the older animals can react more aggressively towards younger animals. When it comes to getting a good piece of food, a nice place to sleep or something else that is important for the dog at that time, this is defended against other dogs, which in some cases may involve aggression.</p>\n<p>A dog that attaches more value to one of the aforementioned necessities of life, will exercise more power at such a moment, after which other dogs will most likely leave him alone. However, this does not mean that this dog is also the most powerful in other cases, it is entirely up to that dog’s motivation to defend what is in between the two individuals at that moment.</p>\n<h2>The Domestic Dog Social Characteristics</h2>\n<p>There are quite a few differences between the wolf, the wild dog, and the domestic dog. Dogs no longer have a coordinated group hunt, every individual in a group can mate and the puppies are only raised by the mother. Dogs also tolerate other dogs in their environment, something wolves hardly do.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, because otherwise, a walk in a dog forest would have been a lot less fun! In that aspect, dogs are completely adapted to our current situation and the social structure of a dog has changed enormously. The social structure of wild dogs can vary enormously and this environment is also very different from how a dog will experience this in our living room.</p>\n<p>The way we keep dogs these days, they are fed enough to eat and there is enough room for everyone to relax, so there is much less competition. After years of discussion, many researchers agree that a dog does not need a real pack leader or dominant figure in a group, but a coach who can indicate where limits lie and what the dog’s expectations are so that a harmonious coexistence can be created.\nIn each house, the owners expect something different from their dogs and his rules are different.

These needs are split up into two categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Dog’s Basic Needs</li>\n<li>A Dog’s Secondary Needs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You probably wonder why your dog needs are split up into two categories. Let me explain this, the basic needs a dog has, are essential for his well-being, security, and survival.\nWithout these, your dog will get all kinds of diseases, he/she will be scared, or in the worst case, your dog dies.</p>\n<p>The secondary needs are there to provide a worthy life for your dog. Think about socializing, exercise, and of course, he/she wants to look good in the mirror too.\nAs you can see are the basic needs of your dog very important for his survival and the secondary needs for his/her happiness, and of course your happiness.</p>\n<p>In this article, I’m going to focus on your dog’s basic needs and why these needs are essential for you as a dog owner and your dog to enjoy life to the fullest. These needs are split up into four categories and are as followed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water</li>\n<li>Food</li>\n<li>Shelter / Heat / Safety</li>\n<li>Access to medical assistance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see they are the same as we humans have. Without these to put it simply you would be thirsty, hungry, cold, warm, wet, scared, or in pain/feeling sick.\nYour secondary needs like socializing with friends/family, having a huge house with a big garden, and looking good in the mirror are not necessary to survive.</p>\n<p>Each need you see above I’m going to explain with more details. You will see that providing these needs is effortless and your dog will be most grateful to you.</p>\n<h2>YOUR DOG’S NEED FOR FRESH WATER</h2>\n<p>Your dog needs fresh and clean water every day.\nThe amount differs with the size of the dog, the amount of activity of the dog and the amount of water and/or salt present in the food.</p>\n<p>The table below shows how much water a dog needs on a certain activity level per lb:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Activity</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weight</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Amount</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Low Activity Level</td>\n<td align=\"center\">per 10 lb</td>\n<td align=\"center\">8.5 fl oz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Medium Activity Level</td>\n<td align=\"center\">per 10 lb</td>\n<td align=\"center\">12.5 fl oz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">High Activity Level</td>\n<td align=\"center\">per 10 lb</td>\n<td align=\"center\">18 fl oz</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But the outside temperature and water and/or salt in your dog’s food have to be kept in mind too. To help you out I created a nice calculator were you have to select your dog’s activity level and put in his weight.</p>\n<p>The results are rounded up “giving extra water doesn’t harm your dog” and on summer days when the sun comes out that extra water will make sure he has enough.\nHaving clean and fresh drinking water for your dog is important for the health and well-being of the dog. So your dog must always have access to clean drinking water in a sufficient amount.</p>\n<p>Most dogs that are kept by us have a plastic, metal or stone water bowl in their living room.</p>\n<p>It is important that there is always enough water in this bowl for the dog.\nThe water bowl will also have to be regularly rinsed or completely cleaned because a mucus layer will appear in the bottom of the bowl in which bacteria will settle that damage the water quality and eventually your pooches health.</p>\n<h2>TAKING CARE OF YOUR DOG BY FEEDING HIM</h2>\n<p>Another basic requirement for dogs is food. A dog needs daily food that is fed in a sufficient amount of healthy food that is suitable for the species and age in a way that suits the dog’s stage of development.</p>\n<p>The amount of food depends on the age, activity, and size of the dog. A dog that is still growing or undertakes many activities or is pregnant will need more food than a dog that lazes around all day.</p>\n<p>These dogs also often have a greater need for other nutrients (<em>eg: high proteins</em> ) or in other proportions. These guidelines can often be found on the packaging or obtained on the advice of the vet.</p>\n<p>It is therefore important to always keep a close eye on things to prevent overweight, underweight or mineral deficiencies.</p>\n<p>Most dogs are fed kibble, although there are also dogs that live on raw meat, cooked food or food scraps. Whatever diet the dog receives, it is important to give the dog a high-quality food to ensure the health of the dog.</p>\n<p>For most dog foods developed by the manufacturer, all important nutrients are already present in the food in the correct amount.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this often does not apply to cheaper food.\nIf a dog is fed homemade food or food scraps, it is important to have good knowledge of quantities, necessary nutrients, and food that must be avoided at all times.</p>\n<p>A dog is not a person and has different needs than us. There are also products that we eat every day and that can make a dog sick and die in the worst case.</p>\n<h2>PROVIDING WARMTH AND SHELTER TO YOUR DOG</h2>\n<p>A dog must be protected against adverse weather conditions and cold. The space in which your dog resides must be sufficiently lit and darkened.</p>\n<p>This is important to meet the ethological and physiological needs of your dog.\nThis space must not contain any objects with sharp edges or protrusions that could cause your dog to injure itself. It is also important that if materials are used, they are not harmful to your dog and must be easy to clean and disinfect.</p>\n<p>It is also important that your dog has sufficient freedom of movement.\nMost dogs will be kept inside the house, but of course, there are dogs that stay often outside, in a kennel, on a lead or completely loose.</p>\n<p>If your dog is staying outside and has been fixed, it is important that the collar is designed in such a way that no strangulation or injury can occur to your dog.\nThe chain or rope that is used must be of a length that your dog can move freely and this freedom of movement must be free of obstacles.</p>\n<p>When you keep your dog outside it is also important that your pooch can seek shelter from heat, cold, rain and wind or have a nice place to sleep. Most people will choose a doghouse to provide this shelter/sleeping place.</p>\n<p>When choosing or building a dog house you want to make sure that your dog has enough space. Some minimal requirements for a doghouse are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Height:</strong> 1,5 x the height of your dog.</li>\n<li><strong>Width:</strong> 1,0 x the height of your dog.</li>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 1,5 x the length of your dog.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s best to lift the doghouse at least 10 cm above the ground to prevent moisture from getting in the house.</p>\n<p>One must also avoid drafts in the loft by means of a draft partition that must be placed between the entrance and the sleeping area from floor to ceiling.\nSome people will also go for an outdoor dog kennel.</p>\n<p>These kennels are mostly with a cover on top to protect your dog from the elements. They are also a lot bigger in size and fenced off so your dog has an outdoor place to eat, drink, play, and sleep.</p>\n<p>In winters it’s important that the drinking water doesn’t freeze, your dog always needs access to clean fresh drinking water.</p>\n<h2>MEDICAL CARE FOR YOUR DOG</h2>\n<p>Your dog must also be safe and protected against injury or illness. Your dog should also, if necessary, have access to medical help to combat ailments.\nIf a dog is sick or injured, a veterinarian must be called in to treat your dog.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>As you learned in this article, water (to stay hydrated), food (for energy and a healthy body), shelter (for warmth, shade, and protection against rain/snow/wind), and medical assistance (to treat injuries/sickness) are of great importance for your dog’s wellbeing and survival.</p>\n<p>The things we described are the minimal recommendations and can be followed but in order to give your dog a happy and secure life, it needs these basics.\nIn ( A Dog’s Secondary Needs ), I explain the secondary necessities like social needs, sufficient freedom of movement and activity, external care, the

Don't make it to long"}},"postBody":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>We provide an answer to this question in this article.\nIn order to properly understand a dog, it is first of all important to know where the appearance and behavior of a dog come from.</p>\n<h1>Dog Domestication</h1>\n<p>Dog and mankind are living successfully together for thousands of years. The oldest found remains of a dog are over 15.000 years old. This makes the dog one of the first successful domesticated animals by mankind.</p>\n<p>Domestication means making a pet out of a wild animal. This doesn’t mean that man only tamed the animal, the wild animal also changed his lifestyle and behavior to live with mankind.</p>\n<p>This process called domestication takes years and years, many generations pass. Domestication always starts with the wild animal that shows less fear for mankind.</p>\n<h1>The Grey Wolf &#x26; Mankind</h1>\n<p>The domesticated dog is relative from the grey wolf.\nThe wolf that at that time lived together with hunters and gatherers, doesn’t exist anymore. This primeval wolf and mankind shared each other’s living environment for thousands of years.</p>\n<p>It looked almost unlikely that these two species would become dependant on each other.\nThe wolf and mankind were, and still, are each other’s competitors about food, which makes it very likely that there was a lot of hatred and envy between parties.\nEven today, this still plays a major role.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we can’t go back in time to see what happened exactly, but with the help of fossils and research, a number of theories have emerged that can somewhat explain this improbable friendship.</p>\n<p>One of these theories tells us that mankind started keeping wolf pups as pets. The reason for this could be that the pups looked cute and mankind had pleasure handling these young wolfs.</p>\n<p>More recent theories have since emerged. The most recent theory tells us that not mankind chose the wolf, but that the wolf chose mankind.\nWolves are real omnivores and could find complete meals around the settlements of man.\nThey lived from our food scraps.</p>\n<p>The wolfs that were least scared for man, were able to eat most of the food and were, therefore, more successful than the timid animals. In this way, a selection was made whereby the tamer wolves could get more puppies and pass on this new behavior to them.\nSlowly the behavior and the appearance of the wolves changed and started to look more and more like a dog.</p>\n<p>These first proto-dogs brought qualities that were useful for mankind. Wolves are very social animals that live in families, similar to those of humans.</p>\n<p>This gave the wolf the opportunity to adapt well to the human family. Also, these dog-like ones could protect their human families, but also watch out for other predators.\nBecause these tame wolves, or proto-dogs, were feeding the food scraps of humans, they also kept the surrounding environment clean so that vermin were kept at a distance.</p>\n<h1>Natural And  Artificial Selection</h1>\n<p>Natural selection made sure that the strongest and most successful survived during reproduction.</p>\n<p>With wolves, for example, it’s important that they have good hunting techniques and large, strong jaws to catch prey and defend themselves with.</p>\n<p>A wolf that lives on human food scraps does not benefit from strong jaws or a good hunting technique, and these qualities can gradually decrease and even disappear completely over time.</p>\n<p>These wolves were more successful if they showed no fear and aggression towards mankind.</p>\n<p>If they would have shown any of these signs the humans would have chased the wolf away, and as a result, they would have gotten fewer food scraps from humans.\nSelection mainly ensured that the dogs could fully adapt to the lifestyles and wishes of humans.</p>\n<p>Animals would also be consciously chosen by humans because of the good qualities they possess, which were useful to humans at the time.\nThis is a form of artificial selection.</p>\n<p>For example, the animal that was most alert to guard the family or the animal that was the most friendly towards the humans received more food or was allowed to have puppies.\nAnimals that did not fit into this picture and therefore exhibited undesirable behavior could have been rejected and perhaps even used for human consumption.</p>\n<p>This recent theory is partly based on how contemporary dogs are still kept with certain tribes.</p>\n<p>Dogs walk around freely in these villages and live mainly from human food scraps while they watch over the village and the cattle.</p>\n<p>This old way of domestication is still happening at the moment, for example, foxes are increasingly adapting to humans and living in the city. These foxes live from our food waste and even sleep regularly in our barns.</p>\n<p>These animals are becoming less and less afraid of humans and are even starting to differ in appearance and behavior from their counterparts in the wild.</p>\n<p>It’s therefore very likely that the former wolf came to live together in a similar way alongside and ultimately with humans.</p>\n<p>Dogs and People turned out to be the perfect partners and were able to live together well over time. Over the past thousands of years, this band has only become stronger.</p>\n<h1>The Appearance  Of The Dog</h1>\n<p>Especially today there is a world of difference between the appearance of a wolf and the modern dog. There are dog breeds that somewhat resemble the appearance of a wolf, but a dog such as a chihuahua or a pug is very far away.</p>\n<p>It’s almost impossible to imagine that a chihuahua is descended from a wolf?\nAs we mentioned earlier, domestication and selection is the reason that these dogs no longer resemble a wolf.</p>\n<p>They have tried to find an explanation for the fact that many dog breeds look so different from the wolf they are descended from. Previous theories tried to explain this.</p>\n<p>For years it was thought that the former humans chose wolf puppies with a somewhat different appearance, simply because it looked special or nice.</p>\n<p>For example, they would have kept a puppy with light-hanging ears or an animal with a different color.</p>\n<p>Humans bred with these animals to pass on these outer differences to the next generation. After a number of generations, these outer differences can take on more extreme forms.</p>\n<p>This selection is still applied daily when creating different animal breeds and even with plants.</p>\n<p>This is how all different breeds of dogs eventually came into being. Yet it was difficult to explain where these first outward differences suddenly came from.\nWhy did a wolf suddenly appear with hanging ears or different color fur? Why would people select these animals?</p>\n<p>Recently a very interesting study  <a href=\"https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12052-018-0090-x\">(The silver fox domestication experiment)</a>\nhas been published that can give some answers to these questions.</p>\n<p>In 1959 Dmitry Belyaev and Lyudmila Trut started breeding and selecting tame foxes in Russia.</p>\n<p>These (silver) foxes were kept for fur. The animals were very anxious and aggressive towards the people they loved, which made it difficult for humans to care for them and to handle them.</p>\n<p>The idea was to breed a fox that was not afraid of humans from birth and showed no aggressiveness. The researcher tested the foxes at a young age.</p>\n<p>The foxes that were less anxious were selected and crossed with other foxes that were less anxious. This was done generation after generation, and already after six generations, there was a very clear difference between these domesticated foxes compared to the normal fox.</p>\n<p>These foxes showed innate tame towards humans and even wanted human attention.\nThey enjoyed being petted and even started wagging their tails when they saw a human being wet like a dog does.</p>\n<p>However, not only the behavior of these domestic foxes changed. To the great surprise of the researchers, the foxes were born with different colors, hanging ears, a shorter snout, curly tails and even with shorter legs.</p>\n<p>The researchers had never deliberately selected foxes for their appearance, only for their behavior.</p>\n<p>The conclusion of this research is that the process of domestication not only changes the behavior of an animal but also changes its appearance automatically.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postAuthor":{"authorBio":{"authorBio":"🍂Hiker Girl
