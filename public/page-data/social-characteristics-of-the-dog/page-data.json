wolf. This is not the official ancestor of our dog, but it is closely related to the dog.</p>\n<h2>The Gray Wolf Social Characteristics</h2>\n<p>The gray wolf is a very social animal that likes to live in groups, also known as packs, although it sometimes happens that a wolf lives alone.\nThese wolf packs have a real family structure that consists of the parent animals and their offspring of different ages. In rare cases, it sometimes happens that wolves from outside are included in the pack, but normally the outside wolves are chased away and in the worst case even killed.</p>\n<p>The two-parent animals <strong>(father and mother)</strong> are the only ones who get couples and puppies. These puppies are raised by them and remain in the pack for many years, sometimes even their entire lives. The entire pack helps to raise the puppies and find food. If the young are old enough to find their own place <strong>(after a few years)</strong> or if there is not enough food for the whole family, they leave the pack voluntarily.\nWolf packs in the wild are harmonious and conflicts are much less common than ever thought. If there is less to eat, for example in the winter, then aggression is more common in a wolf pack.</p>\n<p>The classification of the rank in a pack of wolves consists of the parent animals at the top as the natural leader figures and the young puppies who follow. The youngest puppies are given priority to food until they are old enough to stand up for themselves and help with hunting. The young puppies show respect for their elderly because they depend on them for food and protection.</p>\n<p>Expressions of submissive behavior occur regularly. A common submissive behavior, also known as active submission, is most often observed when the group comes together again or before the group goes hunting.</p>\n<p>During active submission, the performing wolf keeps low to the ground, wags low with the tail and licks the lips of the recipient. This behavior is mainly performed by the younger wolves with the older wolves as a recipient but is also performed to a lesser extent by the older animals.</p>\n<p>Whether this behavior is considered submissive is not always clear and may depend on the context. The behavior can be interpreted as status recognition, but nowadays it is also recognized as a connection ritual with the aim of strengthening the relationship.\nAnother behavior that is also seen is that the wolf turns on its back, often after the intimidation of another wolf. This behavior is also called passive submission because in this case, the other wolf initiates it. This behavior is described as a submissive behavior and probably has the function of avoiding a conflict in which one wolf submits to another wolf.</p>\n<p>Many studies that have been conducted into wolf behavior have since become obsolete. These studies were based on wolf groups that were kept in the zoo. These wolves were often not related to each other, lived in a stressful or too small environment and therefore displayed much aggression towards each other. So conflicts occurred very regularly.</p>\n<p>Recent research into wild wolves found a social structure that had never been seen before.</p>\n<p>Our modern dog comes from a wolf that no longer exists. There is also a time of more than ten thousand years between the wolf and the dog, where behavior and appearance have changed enormously. The social characteristics that we see in our dog are therefore difficult to compare with the social characteristics of the modern wolf, although there are still many behaviors that we will recognize.\nTo find out our dog‚Äôs social structure, we will have to observe dogs in their natural environment. However, what is a natural environment for a dog? Our own living room? The local dog park? In the following sections, we describe the social structure as dogs would classify themselves, with little or no human influence, after which we compare this with our own domestic dog.</p>\n<h2>The Dingo‚Äôs Social Characteristics</h2>\n<p>In Australia lives a dog that ended up in the wild thousands of years ago. These dogs are completely wild today and are therefore a good example of how a dog would organize its own social structure. Dingo‚Äôs often just wandering around looking for food, though there are also large groups who hunt together.</p>\n<p>As far as we know, the bitches raise their youngsters themselves, taking distance from the group until the youngsters are big enough to stand up for themselves. Unfortunately, not much research has been done on dingos in the wild and studies of dingos in zoos are not a good example of the natural situation.</p>\n<p>Also, dingos are so wild that living together with people is very difficult. Dingos are very individual and do not bind well to people. They are also often seen as a burden that causes them to be driven away or killed by people.</p>\n<h2>The Pariah Dog Social Characteristics</h2>\n<p>The pariah dog is a real village dog and can be found in West Bengal. These dogs roam freely in villages and are tolerated by the residents. They live mainly from food waste, but also receive food from the residents. This structure is very similar to how the first dogs lived together with humans and is therefore also a good example of how a dog would classify its social structure alongside humans.</p>\n<p>In these villages, there are sometimes as many as one hundred dogs per village. The dogs are often seen in small family groups, as you see in wolves. Yet every dog lives much more by itself and each individual provides his own food. The dogs are very tolerant towards each other, although a group will defend its territory against unknown dogs.</p>\n<p>Different groups can live close to each other and despite the fact that the territory is being defended, real fights with potentially fatal consequences are rare. Regarding mating behavior, these dogs are very different from how you would see that with wolves. When a bitch is in heat, she mates with different males, who often enter into conflicts with each other to get to the bitch. After heat, one of the males may stay with her until the puppies are born, but the puppies are only raised by the mother. Also when they are older the puppies no longer stay with the mother to help with the upbringing, but they go their own way.</p>\n<p>There is virtually no mention of a structured ranking in a group of pariah dogs. There is no alpha pair or a dominant leader, although it has been observed that the older animals can react more aggressively towards younger animals. When it comes to getting a good piece of food, a nice place to sleep or something else that is important for the dog at that time, this is defended against other dogs, which in some cases may involve aggression.</p>\n<p>A dog that attaches more value to one of the aforementioned necessities of life, will exercise more power at such a moment, after which other dogs will most likely leave him alone. However, this does not mean that this dog is also the most powerful in other cases, it is entirely up to that dog‚Äôs motivation to defend what is in between the two individuals at that moment.</p>\n<h2>The Domestic Dog Social Characteristics</h2>\n<p>There are quite a few differences between the wolf, the wild dog, and the domestic dog. Dogs no longer have a coordinated group hunt, every individual in a group can mate and the puppies are only raised by the mother. Dogs also tolerate other dogs in their environment, something wolves hardly do.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, because otherwise, a walk in a dog forest would have been a lot less fun! In that aspect, dogs are completely adapted to our current situation and the social structure of a dog has changed enormously. The social structure of wild dogs can vary enormously and this environment is also very different from how a dog will experience this in our living room.</p>\n<p>The way we keep dogs these days, they are fed enough to eat and there is enough room for everyone to relax, so there is much less competition. After years of discussion, many researchers agree that a dog does not need a real pack leader or dominant figure in a group, but a coach who can indicate where limits lie and what the dog‚Äôs expectations are so that a harmonious coexistence can be created.\nIn each house, the owners expect something different from their dogs and his rules are different. With one the dog is in bed and with the other, it can only sleep on the floor.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postCategory":{"categorySlug":"dog-care","categoryTitle":"Dog Care"},"postDate":"2019-11-16","updatedAt":"2019-11-16","postDescription":{"postDescription":"Many researchers agree that dogs do not need a real pack leader, but a coach who can indicate him, with assertiveness, the boundaries & rules for a happy coexistence."},"postFeaturedImage":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4988290398126465,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1z3kZWwy1vb8RX1mC082nR/9924aa3d6406a46d19aaa6554ae7980d/DSC00166.jpg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1z3kZWwy1vb8RX1mC082nR/9924aa3d6406a46d19aaa6554ae7980d/DSC00166.jpg?w=200&h=133&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1z3kZWwy1vb8RX1mC082nR/9924aa3d6406a46d19aaa6554ae7980d/DSC00166.jpg?w=400&h=267&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1z3kZWwy1vb8RX1mC082nR/9924aa3d6406a46d19aaa6554ae7980d/DSC00166.jpg?w=800&h=534&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1z3kZWwy1vb8RX1mC082nR/9924aa3d6406a46d19aaa6554ae7980d/DSC00166.jpg?w=1200&h=801&q=50 1200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1z3kZWwy1vb8RX1mC082nR/9924aa3d6406a46d19aaa6554ae7980d/DSC00166.jpg?w=1280&h=854&q=50 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}},"postSlug":"social-characteristics-of-the-dog","postTitle":"Social Characteristics Of The Dog"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"social-characteristics-of-the-dog","tags":"Dog Care"}}}
