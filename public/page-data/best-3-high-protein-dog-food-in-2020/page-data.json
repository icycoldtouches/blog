How did we come to this conclusion? We looked at ingredients (no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives), DMB(P), price, made in a country with high quality and safety standards the food is manufactured (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Western Europe) and reviews.</p>\n<p>As with all reviews, there are people claiming the dog food is bad and harms your dog but this is not always true. As we explained in our article High Protein Dog Food, not every dog is created equally and therefore your dog might get an allergic reaction to the food.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we didn‚Äôt weigh the reviews that heavily instead we checked some claims people made about the brand to see if they were true or not. What we found is that people also leave negative reviews when their dog gets an allergic reaction to the food but in our eyes, that‚Äôs not the manufacturer‚Äôs fault. Your dog is just allergic to a particular ingredient and therefore you should watch your dog‚Äôs health.</p>\n<h2>1.

It is made with several different animal-based proteins and a ton of tasty and nutritious fruits and vegetables. Many owners noted improvements in coat condition and energy level after trying the food.</p>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<p>The only real downside to this recipe (or any other Wellness Core Grain-Free recipe) is its cost. However, this is to be expected of any high-protein dog food, particularly one that is also made without grains. The food is US-made, and it is backed by the manufacturer‚Äôs ‚ÄúWellness Guarantee.‚Äù</p>\n<h3>Why You Should Buy Wellness Core Natural Grain-Free Dry Dog Food Original Turkey &#x26; Chicken</h3>\n<p>Wellness core has an impressive ingredients list.</p>\n<p>A whole protein ‚Äì deboned turkey ‚Äì is listed right at the top of the list, and it is followed by turkey meal and chicken meal, which are both valuable supplemental proteins. Several other animal-derived ingredients, such as chicken fat, chicken liver, and salmon oil, are also included in the recipe.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dry Matter Basis Protein:</strong> 37.7%.</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> Starting from $23.</li>\n<li><strong>Average Customer Review:</strong> <em>4.2 out of 5 stars</em>   1152 customer reviews.</li>\n<li><strong>Produced In:</strong>United States</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x3C;a href=‚Äò<a href=\"https://amzn.to/30RIYYa\">https://amzn.to/30RIYYa</a>' target='_blank' rel='noopener nofollow' class='btn btn__primary‚Äô>Click Here To Buy</a></p>"}},"postCategory":{"categorySlug":"dog-health","categoryTitle":"Dog Health"},"postDate":"2019-11-16","updatedAt":"2019-11-16","postDescription":{"postDescription":"If you‚Äôre sure your pooch needs high-protein food we are going to help you a bit with some research we did on the best 3 brands claiming to have high-protein dog food.
