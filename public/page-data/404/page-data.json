This is legal obligation you as dog owner need to meet. Some countries even ask you to put a muzzle on your dog. So if you travel, make sure to read the legal obligations you need to meet.\n\n## Why does my dog always pull on the leash?\n\nMost will say it is because the dog is excited, happy to be outside and wants to get faster to a certain place. While this is partly true, it is also true that the one that is in front leads the way.\n\nFurthermore, the topic of leading your dog on the leash is closely linked to other areas of life: if you do not control your dog on a leash, it will certainly not be controlled in other areas of life.\n\nBut it is also important that your dog can feel your leadership skills in such important situations as leading him on the leash. If you can not enforce your interests on the leash and let yourself be drawn to each blade of grass, then you probably will not be able to do it in other areas of the dog’s life either. You lose competence in your dog’s eyes. The dog will not follow an incompetent boss, especially not when it comes to secure and defend vital resources: protection, living area, etc.\n\n## How do you train a dog to walk on a leash without pulling?\n\nThe goal of leading on a leash is that your dog walks behind you on a loose leash - in every situation.\n\nYour dog should learn that he must pay attention to you and not you to him. At the moment you may be paying attention to him by constantly asking him to come with you, waiting when he wants to put for the 10h time yet another drop of pee on the grass, or just give in to his sniffing and let him follow each small he finds interesting.\n\nDoes this description seem familiar: dog way in front of you, pulling you wherever he wants to go and you stumbling almost behind him with stretched arm?\n\n## How to stop a dog from pulling on the leash?\n\nFirst of all make peace with the fact that dog training is all about patience, calmness and consistent training.\n\n## Step 1: Training Yourself To Walk Your Dog on a Leash\n\nPay attention to your body language. It should be purposeful and radiate leadership skills: so chest out, shoulder straightened, straight back. Clear your mind of previous bad experiences, breath, YOU can do this!\n\nSet a fixed goal and walk determined towards that goal. Be consistent. Once you leash your dog, you need to demonstrate your leadership skills.\n\nKeep yourself calm and assertive while walking your dog. The moment you lose your cool the tension will travel down the leash and it will change the state of mind of your dog.\n\nMy dog was a dog reactive dog and it took me months of hard work (calmness, consistency, body language checks, repetitions) to get to where I am today: walking by dogs without having my dog react, bark, jump, pull etc.\n\n## Step 2: Training Your Dog to Walk on a Leash\n\n### Introduce\n\nIntroduce your dog to the collar and leash. You can let your puppy wear the collar in the house and you can start leash training in the house first. Choose the correct leash and collar for your dog. Make sure you also feel comfortable with holding the leash and it feels good in your hand.\n\nIt is a leash leading etiquette to lead your dog on your left side. Get used to that and get your dog used to that. Because some dog owners do not train their dogs (a total shame in my opinion - it is like buying a 500 horsepower car and drive every day 30 mph), I thought my dog to heel on both sides, just in case I need to switch sides. I have different commands for the different sides and it is a pleasure to be able to adapt to different situations.\n\n### Teach a Command Word\n\nPut the leash on and just make the puppy follow you. You want to teach that cue that you will use later on when you want the dog to be at your side and follow your lead. I use “heel”, but you can use anything that makes sense to you.\n\nYou will start with cue and gesture in the beginning. The gesture is to help your dog understand the cue. Over the course of time the gesture will become less and less and only the verbal cue will remain. This obviously doesn’t apply to deaf dogs.\n\n### Mark & Reward\n\nWhen your dog is doing what you want, and please understand that NO dog will make a perfect heel the first time training, then you __mark__ the moment and __reward__ your dog. It is enough if the dog starts walking only one step next to you. After that you build it up to 2, 3, 5, 10 etc steps before you mark and reward.\n\n- __The Marker__ can be either a clicker or a word. The word must always be the same word, with same length and intonation. This is why some people prefer the clicker.\n- \n- __The Reward__ is either good ham, chicken, bacon or a toy that is only used for training purposes like a ball, bite tug toy. The reward follows the marker.\n\n## Step 3: Leash-Training Troubleshooting\n\n### Pulling\nRemember why a dog is pulling and walking up front! Yes, desire to get somewhere but it is also because you do not step up as a leader. Check your body language, give the command word and walk like you own the road.\n\nIf your dog starts pulling in a direction, stop and wait for the dog to turn towards you and set him again in the start position - heeling. Give the command again and start walking. Don’t walk only straight ahead. Dogs are not stupid and they kind of know the route and the routine after 5 days. Take another route, the other side of the road.\n\nChange between side of the roads frequently, when the dog least expects it. Turn and go back 10 steps. Turn left, turn right and so on. Adapt it to where you live and don’t do all the time the same thing.\n\nWhen I took my “Canine Good Citizen” Exam (the FCI Version of it), I had to do a certain walking scheme with my dog: walk 12 steps, stop, tell my dog to sit, walk away, turn, go back to my dog and continue with the exercise. After 2-3 weeks of trading I notice that my dog started sitting after the 12 steps before I even got to say sit. Why? Because this little mischievous bundle of sweetness learned “oh heck same thing all the time: after 12 steps I need to sit… here we go, I sit! Boooring”.\n\n## I became boring to my dog!\n\nSo I started then switching things up: sit after 5 steps, after 15, after 10, after 20.\n\n### Lunging\n\nIf your dog is going after something while on a walk — another dog, a car, or skateboarder, for example, try to redirect his attention to you before he has a chance to lunge and create space between you and the target. Be proactive. Get prepared before the target of his frustration or excitement gets too close.\n\nThis type of behavior is more common in __herding breeds__, who like to chase.\n\n### Barking\n\nSome dogs have the habit of barking at other dogs while on a walk. Oftentimes, this behavior comes as a result of lack of exercise. Make sure your dog gets the proper amount of mental and physical stimulation for his breed. If this is still a problem, use the same process as you would if your dog is lunging.\n\nMake sure that you pay attention at your dog’s body language. Dogs will tell you long before they react that they will do that. They can’t say “Hey human! See that jogger coming? His shoes bother the heck out of me so I will go for them when he is in reach!”.\n\nDogs make a very __light change in their demeanour__ to tell what it is going on in their head and if you miss it, then you need to handle the lunging, jumping, barking, etc.\n\nTime, patience and repetition will make YOU better at reading your dog as well it will give your dog the change to learn what is expected of him.\n\n### Leash Etiquette\nLeash laws may require your puppy to walk nicely on a leash and know how to heel when off your property. But, even if they don’t, it’s simply polite puppy behavior to know leash etiquette. With proper leash manners, your dog has more freedom to safely explore the world beyond your front or backyard.\n\nTo those people that are super proud of their off-leashed dogs and are stunned by others that do leash their dogs and shout out ” my dog just wants to play” or ” my dog is harmless”: good for you!\n\nNot all dogs are the same and if the other person is leashing their dog than be respectful and responsible and do the same. Not the dog owner with the leashed dog has a misbehaved dog, but the one that doesn’t leash the dog.\n\nJust because your dog is playful and harmless doesn’t mean that the other dog is and wants to do the same things. You don’t go for coffee with everybody either.\n\nJust because your dog is playful and harmless doesn’t mean that it is true. More often owners don’t know what their dog is doing and what signals the dog is giving to the other dog. \n\nA dog that does not want to play with others and even reacts dismissively and aggressively does not have a behavior problem, but it is rather a natural dog that just likes to be left alone. You don’t allow everybody on the street to hug you either. \n\n__Refer to my training guide for detailed descriptions.__\n\nPuppies do not instinctively know how to walk on a leash. When you pull, dogs instinctively pull back, and if you allow the pup to win, that can make it even more difficult for them to overcome the urge to do it.\n\nIt is much easier to teach a small puppy than a powerful adolescent or adult. If you have a puppy, then now is the perfect time to teach it to walk nicely on a leash. Begin immediately when you bring the pup home. If you have an adolescent or adult dog, here is even more important to walk like a boss and show your dog you can provide guidance, leadership, protection, food, and fun.\n\n>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!

Food","postSlug":"high-protein-dog-food","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"You may have various reasons to feed your dog protein-rich dog food, but for your dog, not all proteins are the same. Fish and Meat are both protein-rich sources but they both contain different nutrients.\n\nSome dog food brands also add additional carbohydrates to their dog food. Most dogs will digest these carbohydrates good when cooked but proteins and fats are their natural diet.\n\nSo how do you know which high-protein dog food to choose for your pooch? Well before we get there it’s important to understand what sources are rich in proteins, healthy for your dog and why your dog might (might not) need protein-rich food.\n\n## What Has The Most Protein?\nWe first want to tell you a bit about protein-rich sources. The four grouped sources below are the ones with the highest concentration in proteins. In the next section, we have a few of these protein-rich sources but there are more like greek yogurt, broccoli, lentils, etc.\n\nSome of these protein-rich sources will have better nutrients than others, in the list below we have the best sources for your pooch.\n\n* **Eggs:** Some dog foods contain egg inside but you can always mix a boiled egg under the food and most dogs will love them.\n\n* **Fish:** Some brands sell food that has some source of fish, the most commonly used fish in these foods is salmon because salmon contains a very high omega-3 fatty acid. Omega-3 helps prevent kidney diseases, arthritis, and high cholesterol.\n\n* **Meat:** Is the most natural source of proteins for your furry friend. The most common meats you will find in dog food are beef, turkey, chicken, duck, and venison.\n\n* **Cheese:** It sounds weird but cheese also contains a lot of proteins. When feeding your dog a cheese-based food it’s important to watch the amount of fat. Some cheeses contain more fat than others.\n\nSome brands will add multiple protein sources to their food. These sources should be listed first on the ingredients list. Most of the proteins should come from chicken, salmon, beef or any other kind of meat.\n\nAs you will see in the next section there are differences in the type of meat used in dog food. In general, it shouldn’t be a problem which source is used for proteins unless your dog has an allergic reaction, when this happens it’s important to talk to your vet to figure out which source created the reaction.\n\n## Protein-Rich Sources For Dogs\nWe made a list with some protein-rich sources for your dog. Each protein source has different nutrients as you can see, that is good for your dog’s health. It’s important to keep in mind that not every dog is created equally, therefore your dog might need more or fewer proteins.\n\n### Hard-Boiled Egg (50 grams)\n* **Carbs:** 0.6 grams.\n* **Fat:** 5.3 grams.\n* **Protein:** 6.3 grams.\n\nEgg also contains **Vitamin A, Vitamin B2 (riboflavin), Vitamin B12 (cobalamin), Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), Phosphorus:** 86mg and **Selenium:** 15.4 mcg.\n\n### Almonds (28 grams)\n* **Carbs:** 0 grams.\n* **Fat:** 14 grams.\n* **Protein:** 6 grams.\n\nAlmonds also contain **Vitamin E, Manganese**and **Magnesium.**\n\n### Chicken Breast (172 grams)\n* **Carbs:**0 grams.\n* **Fat:** 6.2 grams.\n* **Protein:** 53.4 grams.\n\n### Cottage Cheese (226 grams)\n* **Carbs:** 6.1 grams.\n* **Fat:** 2.3 grams.\n* **Protein:** 28 grams.\n\nCottage Cheese also contains **Phosphorus, Sodium, Selenium, Vitamin B12, Riboflavin, Calcium,**and **Folate.**\n\n### Skyr (170 grams)\n* **Carbs:** 7 grams.\n* **Fat:** 0 grams.\n* **Protein:** 19 grams.\n\nSkyr also contains **Phosphorus, Calcium, Riboflavin, Vitamin B-12, and Potassium.**\n\n### Broccoli (91 grams)\n* **Carbs:**6 grams.\n* **Fat:**0.4 grams.\n* **Protein:**2.5 grams.\n\n### Beef (100 grams)\n* **Carbs:** 0 grams.\n* **Fat:** 11.8 grams.\n* **Protein:** 26.1 grams.\n\n### Salmon (124 grams)\n* **Carbs:**0 grams.\n* **Fat:**5.5 grams.\n* **Protein:**31.7 grams.\n\nSalmon also contains **Sodium:**107 mg and **Potassium:**513.36 mg.\n\n### Turkey (100 grams)\n* **Carbs:**0 grams.\n* **Fat:** 3.2 grams.\n* **Protein:** 29.9 grams.\n\nTurkey also contains **Omega-3:** 70 mg, **Omega-6:** 570 mg, **Vitamin B3, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B12, Vitamin B1**and **Folate.**\n\nAs you can see some vegetables also contain proteins and are completely safe to feed your dog. Dogs can eat these protein sources, but keep in mind that the dog’s digestive system is built different and might not extract the nutrients they need from it.\n\nTherefore we recommend to go with a meat-based diet, if you, for some reason, decide to feed your pooch vegetarian it’s really important for your dog’s health to check him regularly, muscles, bones, skin, coat, and blood. Your dog might need extra supplements because the vegetarian meal doesn’t digest and provide enough nutrients.\n\nThe information gathered in the table comes from  [healthline.com](https://healthline.com/)  if you have a source in mind to feed your dog you can always check their site for nutrition facts about the source.\n\n## Does My Dog Benefit From A High Protein Food?\nAs with humans, dogs that are active need more proteins for better muscle, tissue and organ development. The normal average healthy dog needs 1.7 grams of proteins per 1 kg of body weight. That means a dog that weighs 27 kg should get 45.9 grams of proteins.\nWhen your dog is more active it burns more calories meaning you should feed your dog extra proteins and fats to keep his body healthy.\n\nWhat’s an active dog you might ask. Mostly active dogs are the ones used in dog sports. We made a list for you to see if your dog belongs to the active dog group or not.\n\n* **Police Dogs**\n\n* **Military K9s**\n\n* **Search and Rescue Dogs**\n\n* **Herding Dogs**\n\n* **Guard Dogs**\n\n* **Tracking Dogs**\n\n* **Hunting Dogs**\n\n* **Agility Dogs**\n\n* **Canicross Dogs**\n\n* **Disc Dogs**\n\n* **Pregnant Dogs**\n\n* **Nursing Dogs**\n\nThe list contains some of the most common sports a dog can do, but when your dog goes running / biking with you, your dog might also need more proteins.\n\nIf you aren’t sure if your dog needs extra proteins it’s always a good idea to ask your veterinarian to test the blood.\n\n## Medical Concerns of High-Protein Dog Food\nMost dogs will handle a high-protein diet perfectly, but some dogs can better avoid a lot of proteins.\n\nThere is a chance your dog might have an allergy for some protein sources, but this doesn’t mean that your dog has to avoid proteins. Dogs with kidney problems better avoid high protein foods. If you’re not sure if your dog has any of these medical conditions you should ask your vet to test the blood.\n\nRecent research shows that healthy older dogs need more proteins than healthy younger dogs because their metabolic-rate is slower than that of younger dogs.\n\nSigns that your dog doesn’t get enough proteins or has an improper protein to calorie ratio may include any or all of the following.\n\n* **Reduced Growth Rate in puppies**\n\n* **Anemia**\n\n* **Weight Loss**\n\n* **Skeletal muscle atrophy**\n\n* **Dull unkempt hair coat**\n\n* **Anorexia**\n\n* **Reproductive problems**\n\n* **Persistent unresponsive parasitism or low-grade microbial infection**\n\n* **Rapid weight loss after injury or during disease**\n\n* **Failure to respond properly to the treatment of injury or disease**\n\nIf any or all of these signs are visible to your dog call a vet and have him/her checked. Don’t try to solve this yourself as you might damage your dog’s health in the process.\n\n## What Makes A Good High-Protein Dog Food?\nThere are no real guidelines that can be used to label high-protein dog food. But the AAFCO published a  [nutrient requirement](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/management-and-nutrition/nutrition-small-animals/nutritional-requirements-and-related-diseases-of-small-animals)  that states:\n\nThe dietary requirement for protein in healthy adult dogs is satisfied when the dog’s metabolic need for amino acids and nitrogen is satisfied. Optimal diets for growing puppies should contain a minimum of 22% protein as dry matter (AAFCO guidelines) or 45 g protein/1,000 kcal ME for puppies 4–14 wk old and 35 g protein/1,000 kcal ME for puppies >14 wk old (NRC guidelines). Adult dogs require a minimum of 18% protein as dry matter (AAFCO guidelines) or ~20 g protein/1,000 kcal of ME required (NRC guidelines).\n\n*The AAFCO*\n\nThis means that dog foods that exceed these levels are high-protein dog foods. But you are not there just yet! Some suggest that high-protein dog food should contain less than 43% carbohydrates and have at least 30% protein.\n\nWhen reading the labels you will also notice a moisture % in your dog food. This gives you the wrong impression of the actual amount of proteins in the food.\n\nIt’s important to find the dry matter basis (DMB) for the dog food.\n\nTo do this you can use the following formula:\n\n**Protein % / (100 % – moisture %) x 100 = Dry Matter Basis (Protein) %**\nAn example would be:\n34% / (100% – 10%) x 100 = 37.7%\n\nYou can use this formula to calculate any DMB% in your dog food, but in this case, we are talking about proteins so we gave the example to calculate the DMB(P).\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine

2020","postSlug":"the-4-best-dog-collars-and-harnesses-in-2020","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"## Best Dog Collars and Harnesses 2020 - Important Collar and Harness Features\n\n### Material\n\nDepending on the type of collar some are made of cotton, leather, some sort of steel or nylon.\n\nWhile a chain collar is nice during the summer and when the dog enters the water, they are not as suited for a daily basis use.\n\nA leather collar will last you a very long time, making it a good investment.\n\nHarnesses, on the other hand, are made out of a combination of materials. Although you can also find good harnesses made of leather, it will cost you more money. Harnesses, when chosen wisely, will last you very long as well, so it might be worth the investment.\n\nDepending on your dog's fur you can choose either a more protective one (with more material) or a more simple one (material is present mainly on the straps).\n\n### Width\n\nWidth is for me one of the main criteria according to which I chose the daily collar for my dog. The width I prefer is minumum 1in (2,5cm).\n\nFor the harness, I chose also a roundabout 1in (2,5cm) width for the straps.\n\n### Comfort\n\nMake sure that the flat collar of your choice has padding all around the inside of the collar, as well as a protective flap for the buckle. I like the collars to have a separate ring for the dog tags as well. \n\nA comfortable harness will not press on your dog's ness when he is sniffing, and will not create friction between his front legs and strap when walking or running. This means that it is more preferable to have a Y-shaped harness in the front and a good clearance for the dog's front legs.\n\nWatch out with overheating in summer if you use a harness.\n\n### How tight should a dog collar or harness be?\n\nAfter you put the collar on your dog’s neck slip two fingers between the dog’s neck and collar to ensure that it is not too tight. The same measurements I take for the harness as well.\n\nA poorly-fitting collar can affect your dog’s eating, drinking and even breathing, which will obviously lead to catastrophic outcomes. A collar that’s to stiff (like the ones one made from untreated leather) can also cause irritation to the dog’s neck. \n\n## Best Dog Collars and Harnesses 2020 - Dog Collar and Harness Types\n\n### Choke Collars\n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/OLNWa4z6Afd3SI6MkHkz2/1ecf83716ac5846b1556aad39cef45a9/choke_collar.jpg\" alt=\"choke collar\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\nIn essence, these collars are chains that contract and expand, exerting pressure on your dog’s neck.\n\n### E-Collars\n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/276FdKS1Htgto4vkivoi2T/1b4270185b5ff799abaca7239e69cfe6/e-collar.jpg\" alt=\"e-collar\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\nE-collars (electronic collars) deliver a mild to moderate pulse to a dog. \n\n### Martingale Collars\n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/71va3z7X7IPIfygHuz04tC/a88cc8f83090e4da0254a7a3ded9ae33/martingale-collar.jpg\" alt=\"martingale-collar\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\nA martingale collar is made of two loops: one that fits around the dog’s neck and another (the control loop) that attaches to a leash. Because of this construction, it functions much like a choke collar but doesn’t put the same kind of pressure on the trachea.\n\n### Prong Collars\n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5AcbdLZQGwEDVtOK5Yo78B/47e391638a122ad4f95367a085fd6967/prong_collar.jpg\" alt=\"prong collar\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\nProng or pinch collars are similar in design to choke collars, except instead of the links being curved and smooth, an open piece of metal extends beyond the link and pinches the dog’s neck.\n\n### Flat Collars\n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/UKtAMfj8lyW9jbqtXO8My/307ad1d679bf648300fbd066652dd064/dog-collar.jpg\" alt=\"dog-collar\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\nA flat collar is similar to a  human belt. It serves well as a means to maintain positive control of your pet.\n\nFlat collars are the most common collars worldwide. Almost every dog will wear a flat collar at some point in his life, whether during his puppy years or all the time. They come in an array of options, so it is important to choose the right one for your dog’s size and make it fit correctly. \n\nMost of the time you will use one collar that you and your dog will accept the best. Take your time in choosing it and instead of investing in 2-3 collars, make a bigger investment in 1 good one. \n\n### Front-Clip Harness\n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/57W56xFCICBHhDNMBXQXnH/991b4b06d7ab4c46ae9b59ac6f786e8d/fron_clip_harness_1.jpg\" alt=\"fron clip harness 1\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\nA front-clip harness allows you to hook the leash in front of the sternum (chest bone) of the dog.\n\nThe purpose of a front clip harness is to provide you with extra control over your dog. When your dog pulls towards something, the front leash attachment point causes them to pivot around towards you the moment you pull on the leash.  \n\n### Back-Clip Harness\n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4ORu5EMfe1KMPpAJcn1u6r/64226d050229d1830a493e0137800f4d/harness-fun-black-black-l.jpg\" alt=\"harness-fun-black-black-l\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\nA back-clip harness allows you to hook the leash at the back of the harness right on top of the mid-back or between the shoulder blades of your dog. \nThe harnesses are especially useful for small dogs with delicate throats easily damaged by collars. \n\nI have 3 circumstances when I use the above-pictured harness on my dog:\n\n* When I take my dog for hikes and I don’t know the terrain. It is easier to pull out a dog from a ditch by the harness than by the collar or skin.\n\n* When I take my dog alongside my bicycle. I don’t want to accidentally yank his neck with the bike.\n\n* When I have my dog in the car and I use the seatbelt option. Again I don’t want him to be yanked by his neck in case of a strong brake.\n\n\nWhen back-clip harnesses are used with an untrained dog who likes to pull, they create a sled-pulling action, with the owner dragged along in place of the sled. And believe me, dogs are strong :-). \n\n## Top 4 Best Dog Collars and Harnesses 2020 - What Should You Buy?\n\nFor safety reasons, I will not describe nor advertise the use of the choke, electronic, martingale or prong collars. In my opinion, if you think you need to use one of the above, you should consult a professional that can show you how to work with those collars… if really necessary. \n\nI have a reactive dog as well and I only use a flat collar for our normal walks and I can still correct my dog with my voice to not react. It is because we developed a bond and relationship that allows me to do that. \n\n### Flat Collar - PawFurEver Soft & Breathable Padded Leather Dog Collar\n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/UKtAMfj8lyW9jbqtXO8My/307ad1d679bf648300fbd066652dd064/dog-collar.jpg\" alt=\"dog-collar\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\n* 100% Genuine Leather and Comfort: PawFurEver’s handmade real leather dog collar gives your dog a stylish designer look with all the comfort that they deserve.

Explained","postSlug":"the-7-types-of-dog-breeds-explained","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"## Sporting Group\n\nNaturally active and alert, Sporting Dogs make likable and well-rounded companions. \n\nTypically pointers and setters would identify and mark game by pointing, spaniels would flush the game out, and retrievers would be in charge of recovering dead and wounded game. \n\nKnown for their superior instincts in water and woods, many of these breeds enjoy hunting and other field activities. \n\nMany of them, especially the water-retrieving breeds, have well insulated and water repellant coats, which makes these breads quite resilient to the elements.\n\n*__There are four basic types of Sporting Dogs:__*\n\n- Spaniels\n- Pointers\n- Retrievers\n- Setters\n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2jVgK45BS2QIhUhRhC0K9U/6e266ec2a1773f598aef76475465a262/sporting-dog-breeds.jpg\" alt=\"sporting-dog-breeds\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\n\n### Spaniels\n\nIn assisting hunters, Spaniels work within gun range, are steady to shots, able to mark the fall and retrieve shot game with a soft mouth.\n\nA good nose is highly valued, as it is in most gun dog breeds. \n\nThey are versatile hunters and whether hunting in open fields, woodlands, farmlands, in briars, along fencerows or marshlands, a spaniel can get the job done.\n\n*__Spaniel Breeds__*\n\n- American Cocker Spaniel\n- American Water Spaniel\n- Blue Picardy Spaniel\n- Boykin Spaniel\n- Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\n- Clumber Spaniel\n- Drentse Patrijshond\n- English Cocker Spaniel\n- English Springer Spaniel\n- Field Spaniel\n- German Spaniel\n- Irish Water Spaniel\n- King Charles Spaniel\n- Kooikerhondje\n- Markiesje\n- Papillon\n- Phalene\n- Picardy Spaniel\n- Pont-Audemer Spaniel\n- Russian Spaniel\n- Stabyhoun\n- Sussex Spaniel\n- Welsh Springer Spaniel\n\n\n### Pointers\n\nThese dogs are trained for field reconnaissance. \n\nThe moment they sense the prey they freeze in the position they caught the prey’s smell and remain like a statue with a lifted paw and the snout pointing in the direction of the prey. \n\nThey freeze in this position until released by the hunter. \n\nThey are big sized dogs, with expressive eyes, big and floppy ears, a very good sense of smell and with a special passion for searching the prey. \n\nThe Pointers are active through their character, submissive, loyal, and gentle. \n\nHaving a pretty powerful hunter instinct, they are not trustful around small animals, including cats. \n\nMany from these dogs were raised to work far away from the hunter and could have independent thinking, and have the tendency to roam.\n\n*__Pointer Breeds__*\n\n- Brittany\n- French Brittany\n- English Pointer\n- German Shorthaired Pointer\n- German Wirehaired Pointer\n- German Longhaired Pointer\n- German Roughhaired Pointer\n- Italian Spinone\n-

Slovakian Wirehaired Pointer\n- Cesky Fousek\n- Arrange Pointer\n\n\n### Retrievers\n\nRetrievers are originally hunting dogs whose job was to collect the kill. \n\nThat is, the different breeds of this type of dog were bred and trained to collect the game and bring it back to the hunter. \n\nThe retriever’s willingness to please, patient nature and trainability have made breeds such as the Labrador Retriever and Golden Retriever popular as a disability assistance dog.\n\n*__Retriever Breeds__*\n\n- Chesapeake Bay Retriever\n- Curly Coated Retriever\n- Flat-Coated Retriever\n- Golden Retriever\n- Labrador Retriever\n- Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever\n\n\n### Setters\n\nA Setter silently searches for game by scent. When prey is encountered the Setter freezes rather than chasing after the game. \n\nSetters get their name from their distinctive stance: a sort of crouch or “set” upon finding their quarry. \n\nSetter tend to be happy, playful dogs and are usually very friendly both to people and other dogs. \n\nThey have a great deal of energy and require daily exercise.\n\n*__Setter Breeds__*\n\n- English Setter\n- Gordon Setter\n- Irish Red Setter\n- Irish Red and White Setter\n- Llewellin Setter\n\n\n## Working Group\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1k29Apqcs2LqTrOuRBNJ44/8e060068dc2927eb8f41a81339ecc065/_MG_4768.jpeg\" alt=\"Working Group\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\n\nDogs that are categorized into the Working Group have historically been responsible for tasks ranging from pulling sleds and carts to guarding flocks and homes. \n\nThese dogs include farm and draft animals, security, police, and military dogs, as well as guide and service dogs. \n\nAs such, they make dependable, loyal pets with incredible intelligence and energy.\n\nWithout the right training, some working dogs can be difficult to handle, even dangerous, some working dog breeds may not be for the first-time dog owner. \n\nThere are over 50 dogs in this group, so I mention here the most popular ones.\n\n*__Working Dog Breeds__*\n\n- Rottweiler\n- Boxer\n- Siberian Husky\n- Great Dane\n- Doberman Pinscher\n- Mastiff\n- Bernese Mountain Dog\n- Cane Corso\n- Newfoundland\n- Akita\n- St.Bernard\n- Portuguese Water Dog\n- Bullmastiff\n- Alaskan Malamute\n- Samoyed\n- Great Pyrenees\n- Dogues de Bordeaux\n- Greater Swiss Mountain Dog\n- Giant Schnauzer\n- Standard Schnauzer\n- Leonberger\n- Neapolitan Mastiff\n- Boerboel\n- Tibetan Mastiff\n- German Pinscher\n- Kuvasz\n- Komodor\n- Chinook\n- Akbash Dog\n- Alano Espanol\n- Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog\n- Appenzeller Sennenhund\n- Argentine Dogo\n- Blue Lacy\n- Canadian Eskimo Dog\n- Fila Brasileiro\n- Perro de Presa Canario\n- Seppala Siberian Sleddog\n- Tamaskan Dog\n- Wetterhoun\n- Alaskan Husky\n- Alopekis\n- American Mastiff\n- Mountain Cur\n\n\n## Toy Group\n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5i3p4deI6NrHEAtJV1mqbN/7ae97056d7584a0d809f2a5499414b63/toy-dogs.jpg\" alt=\"toy group\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\nThe toy breed was bred for the purpose of serving as companions for their humans. \n\nThese small, easily portable dogs can be most often found sitting in the lap of their humans or being carried around, have been bred down from their larger cousins. \n\nIdeal for anyone with limited space, these little fellas are intelligent, sociable, and full of energy, and despite their small stature, many do have strong protective instincts and big personalities. \n\nThere are over 20 dogs in this group, so I mention here the most popular ones.\n\n*__Toy Group Breeds__*\n\n- Silky Terrier\n- English Toy Spaniel\n- Yorkshire Terrier\n- Affenpinscher\n- Toy Poodle\n- Beaglier\n- Bolognese Dog\n- Biewer Terrier\n- Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka\n- Toy Manchester Terrier\n\n\n## Herding Group\n\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/3RMiu6JXCjcSdBWG6cdiiv/00e447615e744e8cb55c3a1dcd5b6947/dsc00166.jpg\" alt=\"Herding Group\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n\nThis group includes 30 breeds in a wide variety of sizes, from the Corgi to the German Shepherd with the most straightforward task. Herding dogs have historically been bred to gather, herd, and protect livestock, and work closely with human shepherds.

\n\nGenerally, the charming, affectionate dogs in this group will make loyal companions and family pets. \n\nSome will require more vigorous exercise than others and more intense training than some.\n\nThere are three types of hound, with several breeds within each type:\n\n- Sight Hounds\n- Scent Hounds\n- Miscellaneous Hounds\n\n<img

post__content--image-center\"/>\n\n### Sight Hounds\n\nSight Hounds Sleek, long-legged sighthounds rely on their explosive speed, incredible stamina, and sharp, wide vision to chase fast animals like jackrabbits and antelope and either bring them down or hold them at bay until the hunter arrives.\n\n*__Sight Hound Breeds__*\n\n- Afghan Hound\n- Azawakh\n- Borzoi\n- Galgo Barbucho Patagonica\n-

Hounds\n\nScent hounds are responsible for using their acute sense of smell to track game and are known for being more rugged and durable and having the ability to trail just about anything—whether it’s a squirrel or a missing person.\n\n*__Scent Hound Breeds__*\n\n- American Black and Tan Coonhound\n- Bluetick Coonhound\n- American English Coonhound\n- Redbone Coonhound\n- Alpine Dachsbracke\n-

Otterhound\n- Polish Hound\n- Porcelaine\n- Spanish Hound\n- Transylvanian Hound\n\n### Miscellaneous Hounds\n\nA number of breeds do not hunt solely by speed, sight, and scent, pursuing their prey using both sight and scent. \n\nThese breeds are difficult to classify, as they are neither sighthounds nor scenthounds.\n\n*__Miscellaneous Hound Breeds__*\n\n- Basenji\n- Podenco Canario\n- Cirneco

post__content--image-center\"/>\n\n\nTerrier is a type of dog originally created to hunt earthy animals: rats, moles, badgers. \n\nTerrier breeds vary greatly in size and form, but there’s one thing which is common to all is their feisty, mischievous personality and energetic nature. \n\nEven small terriers take the __“I’m in charge”__ attitude which can be a problem if they’re not socialized and trained. \n\nThey will challenge much bigger dogs, so you must be on your toes when around other dogs.\n\nBull Terrier breeds were once created for bull baiting and dogfights, but, happily, they are now some of today’s companion dogs.\n\n*__Terrier Dog Breeds__*\n\n- Miniature Schnauzer\n- West Highland White Terrier\n- Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier\n- Scottish Terrier\n- Airedale Terrier\n- Bull

Dogs are all the dogs that remain.

Puppy","postSlug":"how-do-you-recognise-fatigue-in-a-puppy","postAuthor":{"authorName":"Alexandra","authorSlug":"alexandra"},"postBody":{"postBody":"Your puppy will get tired of all the new experiences and incentives. If your puppy gets tired, it’s time to stop the activity that you are doing.\n\nThe processing of stimuli is mainly done during sleep. To be able to dose properly your puppy’s training it is therefore important that you recognise the fatigue signals of your young dog.\n\nThere are several things that you can see when a puppy gets tired. Mimic is one of them.\nIf you look at the face of your puppy, you can look at the eyes, ears and mouth.\n\n## The Mouth\n\nWhen we start with the mouth then you can notice that a puppy is starting to get tired or starts getting warm because because of the panting. \n\nThe mouth opens slightly with the corners of the mouth pulled slightly backwards.\nOn the mouth you can notice even more fatigue. The puppy will bite harder or more when he gets tired. All pups bite, but when a pup gets tired, the intensity and frequency can increase.\n\n## The Ears\n\nYou can also read a lot of information on the ears of your puppy. Tired puppies let their ears hang slightly on the side of their head.\n \nThis happens with hanging ears as well as with standing ears. The ears then seem to hang a little ‘Half stick’.\n\n## The Eyes\n\nPuppy’s eyes always provide information. When tired, the eyes may turn a little red. \nThe lower eyelids of the dogs that are looser in their skin can hang down a bit (especially with the larger breeds).\n\nThe look of a puppy will change. When a puppy realises that he is tired and he is able to find its peace, you will see that it has half closed eyes.\n\n## Eye Bags\n\nAnother clear signal on your dog’s face is the appearance of “eye bags”. These bags are lines under the eyes that are about halfway between the eyes and the mouth.\nThese are veins that fill because the corners of the mouth are pulled slightly backwards. These lines form with fatigue, stress and heat.\n\nWith a puppy you see these lines appear quite quickly when you play with him or when he is in a new environment.\n\n## The Crazy Five Minutes\n\nEveryone knows this one. It is that moment when puppies and adult dogs start running in a frenetic manner. Many puppies also add a lot of biting and often they are not accountable for their behaviour at that time.\n\nThere is usually a fixed period of time on the day in which this happens, and that is usually the end of the afternoon or the beginning of the evening. A whole day has already passed for the puppy: walked several times, did some exercises, played, chewed and maybe made a socialisation trip or had a visit.\n\nAfter such a full day, it may happen that your puppy is extremely tired, but is unable to realise that he should go to sleep.\n\nOr he does not have the peace to go to sleep because he is so busy in his head.\nThe puppy can then go wild and be frenetic running around the garden or from one room to another or chase his own tail. The crazy five minutes or the zoomies.\nAt the end of this crazy five minutes the puppy eventually falls asleep, but often it happens that the puppy in the middle of the game with someone in the house becomes too frenetic and starts biting too hard.\n\nThe puppy is tired, stressed or super excited and as he shows, he is unable to calm himself in that situation. The best solution is, after the zoomies moment passed, is to ensure that your puppy is put in his bench or his bed for a while so that he can find the peace and quiet to sleep.\n\nIn the bench or the bed you can put some safe toys that the pup can bite or chew on to get rid of the tension.\nIf no further attention is paid to the puppy, it usually falls asleep within a couple of minutes.\n\n### What To Do When You See One Of These Signals\n\nIf you see one or more of these signals, then your puppy is ready for a nap!\nIf the puppy does not get any moments of rest or if he cannot take a rest himself, it is important to give him structured rest moments.\n\nThis can be achieved in a bench or in a room where there is little activity and external stimulation so that the puppy will fall asleep. \n\nIf you continue to play when the puppy is already tired, then the game can degenerate and the chances are you end a game in a negative manner, enabling “bad” memories to the puppy.\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canine Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog Care","categorySlug":"dog-care"},"postDate":"2019-11-17T00:00","postDescription":{"postDescription":"A tired puppy is no longer able to record new information.

Alcohol\nAlcoholic beverages and food products containing alcohol can cause vomiting, diarrhea, decreased coordination, central nervous system depression, difficulty breathing, tremors, abnormal blood acidity, coma, and **even death**. \n\nUnder no circumstances should your dog be given any alcohol.\n\n# 2. Chocolate, Coffee, and Caffeine\nThese products all contain substances called methylxanthines, which are found in cacao seeds, the fruit of the plant used to make coffee, and in the nuts of an extract used in some sodas. When ingested by dogs, these ingredients can cause vomiting, diarrhea, panting, excessive thirst and urination, hyperactivity, abnormal heart rhythm, tremors, seizures, and **even death**. \n\nNote that darker chocolate is more dangerous than milk chocolate. White chocolate has the lowest level of methylxanthines, while baking chocolate contains the highest.\n\n# 3. Citrus\nThe stems, leaves, peels, fruit, and seeds of citrus plants contain varying amounts of citric acid, essential oils that can cause irritation and possibly even central nervous system depression if ingested in significant amounts. Small doses, such as eating the fruit, are not likely to present problems beyond minor stomach upset.\n\n# 4. Coconut, Coconut Water and Coconut Oil\nWhen ingested in small amounts, coconut and coconut-based products are not likely to cause serious harm to your dog. The flesh and milk of fresh coconuts do contain oils that may cause an upset stomach, loose stools or diarrhea.\n\nCoconut water is high in potassium and should not be given to your dog.\n\n# 5. Grapes and Raisins\nThese fruits can cause **kidney failure** thus avoid feeding grapes and raisins to dogs.\n\n# 6. Macadamia Nuts\nMacadamia nuts can cause weakness, depression, **vomiting, tremors,**and **hyperthermia** in dogs. Signs usually appear within 12 hours of ingestion and can last approximately 12 to 48 hours.\n\n# 7. Milk and Dairy\nBecause dogs do not possess significant amounts of lactase (the enzyme that breaks down lactose in milk), milk and other dairy-based products cause them **diarrhea** or other digestive problems.\n\n# 8. Nuts\nNuts, including almonds, pecans, and walnuts, contain high amounts of oils and fats. The fats can cause **vomiting and diarrhea**, and potentially **pancreatitis** in dogs.\n\n# 9. Onions, Garlic, Chives\nThese vegetables and herbs can cause **gastrointestinal irritation** and could lead to **red blood cell damage.**\n\n# 10. Raw/Undercooked Eggs\nRaw eggs can contain bacteria such as Salmonella and E. coli that can be harmful to dogs and humans. Raw eggs contain an enzyme called avidin that decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin), which can lead to skin and coat problems.\n\n# 11. Salt and Salty Snack Foods\nSigns that your dog may have eaten too many salty foods include **vomiting, diarrhea**, depression, **tremors, elevated body temperature**, seizures, and **even death**. As such, we encourage you to avoid feeding salt-heavy snacks like potato chips, pretzels, and salted popcorn to your dog. \n\n# 12. Xylitol\nXylitol is used as a sweetener in many products, including gum, candy, baked goods, and toothpaste. It can cause insulin release in dogs, which can lead to **liver failure**. \n\nThe increase in insulin leads to hypoglycemia (lowered sugar levels). Initial signs of toxicosis include **vomiting, lethargy, and loss of coordination**. Signs can progress to **seizures**. Elevated liver enzymes and liver failure can be seen within a few days.\n\n# 13. Avocado\nAvocados contain a substance called persin, which is toxic to dogs and can cause vomiting and diarrhea.\n\n# 14. Cherries\nCherry pits contain cyanide, which is poisonous. They can also be a choking hazard or block the intestines if a dog swallows them.\n\n# 15. Bread dough\nWhile bread is generally safe for dogs, the dough can be very dangerous. The yeast in dough can cause it to keep expanding inside the dog’s stomach, which can cause bloating and lead to dangerous complications. The yeast also produces ethanol, and this can cause alcohol poisoning.\n\n# 16. Cinnamon\nAlthough not toxic, large amounts of cinnamon can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and liver disease in dogs.\n\n**If you suspect that your dog has ingested dangerous foods, contact your veterinarian immediately.**\n\n> Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\n> Furry Canines Team"},"postCategory":{"categoryTitle":"Dog
