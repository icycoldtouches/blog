Owners try to redirect the dog‚Äôs attention, but let‚Äôs be honest here: it does not solve the problem.\nProbably the dog‚Äôs nose is towards the owner but its eyes and attention not.</p>\n<h3>Flexible Leashes</h3>\n<p>If you have one, throw it away. Why would you have a leash at which your dog can pull? So not only he is leading you but he also learns leash = pulling and be the leader. This might be worse leash you could own honestly. Sorry if someone‚Äôs feelings are hurt, but there is no grey zone with dogs. </p>\n<h3>Spray Collars, E - Collars, Prongs, and Co.</h3>\n<p>Just No. I have seen other trainers use all kinds of equipment, but I am just not fond of equipment that produces pain. If your kid is misbehaving do you taser him or her? </p>\n<h2>Good Equipment</h2>\n<h3>Collars</h3>\n<p>Grab a sturdy wide collar. It should be one that you can adjust to fit it to your dog‚Äôs neck. </p>\n<h3>Leashes</h3>\n<p>Take a long enough leash that can hang like a U between you and the dog. I prefer this length because I can maneuver around and still have a loos leach on my dog. </p>\n<p>The collar + leash combo is similar to taking your kid‚Äôs hand and going out. Through this combination, you communicate to your dog EVERYTHING so take your time and choose a good fit for both of you. </p>\n<h3>Food and Toys - Motivational Equipment</h3>\n<p>Motivational equipment is key in dog training. Have the dog‚Äôs favorite food or its favorite toy with you at all times. Teach your dog to carry its toy or food bag. </p>\n<p>You can change your walks into little hunting adventures: hunt for food, look for the toy, Get creative! You and your dog will love it. </p>\n<h3>Body Language</h3>\n<p>This is the most important one! You can not lead a dog if you don‚Äôt feel confident in yourself. Why should the dog trust you and think you can keep it safe if your energy is not strong? </p>\n<p><strong>Be confident.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Be assertive.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Be present - don‚Äôt play with your phone.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Be a leader.</strong></p>\n<h2>How To Stop Dog Aggression Guideline</h2>\n<h3>Activity</h3>\n<p>Lack of activity can lead to lethargy, depression, restlessness, and even aggression. The best remedy is to give the dog a job. Physical and mental employment are awesome. With less than 16 hours of sleep per day, a dog can start to get stressed. So the question arises of what is the right job for the dog. </p>\n<p>You should always pay attention to the instincts of the dog and its individual preferences. A hound will love if you will engage in hunting activities with him, like hunting for its food. You could hide a dummy fool with food and make the hound search for it.</p>\n<p>A herding dog will go crazy chasing balls, frisbees for example, which is also a form of hunting. </p>\n<p>Man-trailing for those dogs that love to work with their nose. Agility training for the Aussies and Collies. </p>\n<h3>Increase Frustration Threshold</h3>\n<p>Does a dog pull on the leash to get to a specific peeing spot, jumps out of the cars as soon as the door opened, runs out of the gate or house for as soon as it cracks open a bit, or even jumps and run the moment you take the leash in your hand? If the answer is yes to at least one of those situations, then the dog has a very low frustration threshold. </p>\n<p>The solution is teaching the dog patience. Examples: if you take the leash and the dog is jumping and so on, then the leash goes back in its place. Try 5 min later. Tell the dog to sit calmly. If the dog does it then the leash goes on. If not leash goes away. Same idea with house and car doors. If the dog doesn‚Äôt sit the door closes again. Be consequent for about 1 week and you will see that the dog understands ‚Äúif I am calm, I get the good stuff‚Äù idea. </p>\n<h3>Good Leash Skills</h3>\n<p>I will try to paint a picture in your head with words. Your body language has to be as follows:</p>\n<p>Square shoulders, gaze forwards, chest up, chin up. The arm attached to the hand that holds the leash is relaxed and down. The leash in your hand is held with no tension or strength, just laying loose in your palm. </p>\n<p>The dog is on the left side sitting with his entire body behind the line of your feet. It‚Äôs head at your leg. By the way, the left side comes from the hunting times back in the days when the dog was on the left side of the hunter because on the right side they had the hunting rifle. </p>\n<p>You will notice that people that train their dogs will keep their dogs on the left side. People that don‚Äôt train their dogs have a dog walking all over the place with no structure. You can teach your dog to walk either left or on the right side so that no matter who you have in front of you, your dog has structure and you lead the dog through the encounter.</p>\n<p>When you start walking, you give the command (heel or walk or whatever word you have for the dog following you) and start walking with the same leg that is near the dog - left if the dog sits left, right if the dog sits right. This helps the dog a bit to get into the movement. Don‚Äôt pop the leash and give the ‚Äúheel‚Äù command at the same time - you will just confuse the dog. </p>\n<p><strong>Leash popping is for corrections only, not for commands.</strong></p>\n<p>In movement, the dog has to adapt to your speed, not you to his. Be aware of that.\nWhen you stop, the dog stops and either assume a sitting position by default or stands depends how you teach the dog. </p>\n<h3>Obedience</h3>\n<p>Obedience training is the key to success. Success is having a good recall, having a calm dog, having a good walk, having a balanced relationship with your dog. </p>\n<h3>Territorial Responsibility</h3>\n<p>Territorial responsibility is when you allow, probably unconsciously, your dog to take responsibility for the house and/or garden. This behavior can lead to aggressive behavior like jumping on guests, barking at guests, jumping and barking at people and dogs passing near the fence. The dog can even ‚Äúterrorize‚Äù the owner and the family in their own house. You as an owner need to step up here and regain control by showing your dog boundaries. </p>\n<h3>Keep a Cool Head</h3>\n<p>Easier said than done. This will take patience and time for you to learn how to keep calm and walk on. This means instead of reacting directly negatively and this your dog will notice right away, try to tell yourself ‚ÄúI Got This!‚Äù, start whistling, laughing whatever makes it possible for you to redirect the negative into positive and allows you to stay in charge. </p>\n<p>Remember that your dog observes you ALL the time you are around him/her, so your dog knows exactly when you are anxious, nervous, calm, happy, angry. </p>\n<h3>When To Intervene</h3>\n<p>The timing and the manner you intervene to correct a dog is crucial. It is impossible to describe the right timing in a blog because it depends entirely on the situation, location, dog, owner, personalities. If your work by yourself, have a family member or friend film you. See your mistakes on video and try to improve for the next walk. </p>\n<h3>Praise</h3>\n<p>Make it easy for the dog to succeed. The easier it is, the more the dog will succeed and the more positive feedback it gets.  </p>\n<h3>Correct</h3>\n<p>It is your responsibility as an owner to provide the dog with the social structure it needs to be able to function in human society. </p>\n<p>When you correct you can do it by popping the collar, by blocking the dog‚Äôs path, by changing direction (such a powerful maneuver) or you can touch your dog to snap him out. Be mindful in case your dog redirects the aggression towards your hand.</p>\n<p>Important is a sovereign, targeted, authentic and controlled correction. You want to have a direct success with the correction. However, should your correction attempts have zero effect, it is pointless to continue. Sometimes corrections can escalate the situation making it even worse. </p>\n<p>If you use a correction way too many times you can make your dog immune to that correction. This might even make you amplify the correction, which is not recommended at all.</p>\n<h3>Educate Through Bonding</h3>\n<p>Paying attention to your dog‚Äôs needs and fulfilling them leads to a wonderful bond that will last a lifetime. Achieving the bond will change your dog‚Äôs behavior. Your dog will pay attention to you, if he runs free he will look back all the time to see where you are, it will be game-changing.</p>\n<h3>Change Behavior</h3>\n<p>A behavior change in your dog means a behavior change in you. Your dog acts and reacts because of how you act and react. It is you, as a responsible owner, that needs to adapt to the dog‚Äôs needs and be able to create an environment fit for the dog you have. It is similar a bit with getting a baby. With a baby, you have the responsibility to care for it, feed it, etc. </p>\n<h3>Dog Buddies</h3>\n<p>Although you might have the impression that with an aggressive dog, there is no way to find a dog buddy for yours, I have a different opinion. There is always another dog around that will tolerate yours, and even teach him some manners. So head high, talk to different dog owners, try (safety first), and your dog will find a buddy as well. The best experiences I had were always with the opposite sex as my dog‚Äôs. </p>\n<h3>Distractions: Snacks, Toys, and Co.</h3>\n<p>All the distractions on the planet will not solve your problem honestly. You can get your dog fat, distract with the ball, and the moment the bribe is gone you have a dog that is throwing a fit again. I don‚Äôt say they don‚Äôt work at all. You can use them to pass a dog or distract, but the root cause of the reactivity stays. Teach your dog a solid ‚Äúheel‚Äù command and have a good leash skill and that will help you more than bribing.</p>\n<h3>Systematic or Flooded Desensitisation</h3>\n<p>Desensitization in a dog means that you add slowly, and start will small doses, a trigger to the dog‚Äôs environment to make him immune to that certain trigger. You can do that with other dogs if yours is dog aggressive, with the doorbell, with the sound of fireworks, etc. </p>\n<p>My dog was afraid of the car. So each time I wanted to get him in the car, I could see on his body language that he would rather run 100k than get in the car. So I started getting him in the car, giving him a snack, and get back out. The next step you turn the engine on, stay in the parking lot, then off and done. Days later we took a ride and all was good. This is called a <strong>systematic</strong> desensitisation. </p>\n<p><strong>Flooding</strong> means you put the dog in the middle of whatever bothers him and let him stay there until, some people say, the dog will be cured. Since the dog can not run away, nor hide, the only thing he can do is resign. Not a fan of this method honestly.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Not one method fits all dogs. You need to test, try and fail, try and succeed until you find the methods that work for your dog. If a trainer is trying to tell you his method is the one and only, listen, try it, and if it doesn‚Äôt work for your dog, move on.\nRemember it takes patience and time to succeed, but it worth every minute.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"postCategory":{"categorySlug":"dog-training","categoryTitle":"Dog
