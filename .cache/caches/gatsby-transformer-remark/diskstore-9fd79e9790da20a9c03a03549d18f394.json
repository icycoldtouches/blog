Clickers work because they provide a consistent and reproducible signal that indicates to the dog in training that he has just earned a reward.</p>\n<p>The clicker also bridges the time gap between the dog’s behavior and the delivery of the reinforcing reward. </p>\n<p>It might take only a second or two to deliver a treat to your dog’s lips when he sits in front of you and you have clicked a clicker, but if you are teaching him a command at a distance, the click of the clicker lets him know that what he is doing is the behavior that has earned him a reward, which he will enjoy as soon as he returns to you or you go to him.</p>\n<h2>Charging The Clicker for Dog Training</h2>\n<p>Before you do anything with clicker training exercises, you need to explain to your dog what the clicker is. The way that you do this is called, charging the clicker.</p>\n<p>This means that you will pair something that is meaningless or neutral to your dog (like the click from a clicker), with something that has meaning to the dog (like food).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The easiest way to do this is to put some treats on the counter beside you, then get your dog’s attention, <strong>and then simply click and treat</strong>.</li>\n<li>Continue charging the clicker this way for at least 20 repetitions. You can repeat this twice a day for a couple of days.__ After two days of charging the clicker__, test your dog.</li>\n<li>Test this in another location away from where you normally train and without presenting treats to your dog. Have just a few treats in your pocket without your dog noticing them.</li>\n<li>Then, out of the blue <strong>“click”</strong>. You will know by your dog’s response if he has connected the marker with the oncoming treat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If he acts excited and expects a reward, he has connected the sound of the clicker with the follow reward.</p>\n<p>If he is hesitant or doesn’t react at all, he still didn’t get it. No problem! Simply do a few more charging the clicker training sessions, and test again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is ALL about the timing with conditional training. If you present the treat before you click or if you click after the dog is already eating the treat, your dog will not make the association between the clicker’s sound and the reward.</li>\n<li>During the phase of charging the clicker you don’t ask your dog to perform any action like sit, down, etc. Your dog is simply learning the meaning of the clicker: click = reward.</li>\n<li>Click or mark only once. The purpose of the clicker is to mark the specific behavior in the moment when it occurs, nothing more nothing less. If you click multiple times you will face issues when you start more demanding exercises, because your dog won’t understand which behavior he is getting the reward for. So confusion sets is, leaning to frustration on your and the dog’s side.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How To Clicker Dog Training</h2>\n<p>Here is the magical formula:</p>\n<p><em><strong>(Command –>) Wanted Behavior –> Clicker –> Reward</strong></em></p>\n<p>The reason I used <strong>“command”</strong> in brackets is simply because if you start with a puppy and he knows no commands at all, then you may take the operant conditioning training method to deliver the marker click.</p>\n<h3>Find a Quiet Spot</h3>\n<p>In the beginning you want your dog’s undivided attention, so it’s best to find a quiet spot in your home where it is only you and your dog. You’ll also find it best to eliminate as many distractions outside the training area as possible. </p>\n<h3>Operant Behavior</h3>\n<p>Keep your clicker and a handful of treats handy, and whenever you catch your dog doing something you like, simply click and treat. You may be surprised at how quickly your dog can learn new behaviors this way.</p>\n<h3>Give the Command</h3>\n<p>Keep your clicker and a handful of treats handy, give the command you want your dog to perform and the moment he did it click and reward.</p>\n<h3>Reward Small Progress</h3>\n<p>Let’s say you want your dog to learn to hold an object in his mouth. The first thing a dog might do is look at the object. Click and reward. After that he might touch it with the nose. Click and reward. After that he might open his mouth just a little bit. Click and reward. You see where this is going. Keep it small and reward the behavior that is going towards the goal.</p>\n<h3>Build the Behavior</h3>\n<p>Sticking with the example above, if your dog touches the object and opens his mouth and hold the object just for 1 second, now you click and reward. This was a chain of actions he did correctly and it shows the dog the direction of the exercise.</p>\n<h3>Reward the Full Behavior</h3>\n<p>Once your dog has the object in his mouth and holds it proudly awaiting for the click, you can choose to extend the period of time he holds the object and then click and reward. Make sure to vary the time. Dogs are super smart and I swear they can count and tell when it is time for you to click and reward.</p>\n<h3>Remove the Clicker</h3>\n<p>Once the behaviour is well established, and the dog does it and understands the command, it is time to stop the clicking. The clicker is only a training tool. It is not meant to be used forever. The rewards also will vary and will not come after each time the behavior is displayed. Keep it interesting for you dog and keep your dog guessing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy! Furry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}
