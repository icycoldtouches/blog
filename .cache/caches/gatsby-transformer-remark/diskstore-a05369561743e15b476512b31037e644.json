Alcohol</h1>\n<p>Alcoholic beverages and food products containing alcohol can cause vomiting, diarrhea, decreased coordination, central nervous system depression, difficulty breathing, tremors, abnormal blood acidity, coma, and <strong>even death</strong>. </p>\n<p>Under no circumstances should your dog be given any alcohol.</p>\n<h1>2. Chocolate, Coffee, and Caffeine</h1>\n<p>These products all contain substances called methylxanthines, which are found in cacao seeds, the fruit of the plant used to make coffee, and in the nuts of an extract used in some sodas. When ingested by dogs, these ingredients can cause vomiting, diarrhea, panting, excessive thirst and urination, hyperactivity, abnormal heart rhythm, tremors, seizures, and <strong>even death</strong>. </p>\n<p>Note that darker chocolate is more dangerous than milk chocolate. White chocolate has the lowest level of methylxanthines, while baking chocolate contains the highest.</p>\n<h1>3. Citrus</h1>\n<p>The stems, leaves, peels, fruit, and seeds of citrus plants contain varying amounts of citric acid, essential oils that can cause irritation and possibly even central nervous system depression if ingested in significant amounts. Small doses, such as eating the fruit, are not likely to present problems beyond minor stomach upset.</p>\n<h1>4. Coconut, Coconut Water and Coconut Oil</h1>\n<p>When ingested in small amounts, coconut and coconut-based products are not likely to cause serious harm to your dog. The flesh and milk of fresh coconuts do contain oils that may cause an upset stomach, loose stools or diarrhea.</p>\n<p>Coconut water is high in potassium and should not be given to your dog.</p>\n<h1>5. Grapes and Raisins</h1>\n<p>These fruits can cause <strong>kidney failure</strong> thus avoid feeding grapes and raisins to dogs.</p>\n<h1>6. Macadamia Nuts</h1>\n<p>Macadamia nuts can cause weakness, depression, <strong>vomiting, tremors,</strong>and <strong>hyperthermia</strong> in dogs. Signs usually appear within 12 hours of ingestion and can last approximately 12 to 48 hours.</p>\n<h1>7. Milk and Dairy</h1>\n<p>Because dogs do not possess significant amounts of lactase (the enzyme that breaks down lactose in milk), milk and other dairy-based products cause them <strong>diarrhea</strong> or other digestive problems.</p>\n<h1>8. Nuts</h1>\n<p>Nuts, including almonds, pecans, and walnuts, contain high amounts of oils and fats. The fats can cause <strong>vomiting and diarrhea</strong>, and potentially <strong>pancreatitis</strong> in dogs.</p>\n<h1>9. Onions, Garlic, Chives</h1>\n<p>These vegetables and herbs can cause <strong>gastrointestinal irritation</strong> and could lead to <strong>red blood cell damage.</strong></p>\n<h1>10. Raw/Undercooked Eggs</h1>\n<p>Raw eggs can contain bacteria such as Salmonella and E. coli that can be harmful to dogs and humans. Raw eggs contain an enzyme called avidin that decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin), which can lead to skin and coat problems.</p>\n<h1>11. Salt and Salty Snack Foods</h1>\n<p>Signs that your dog may have eaten too many salty foods include <strong>vomiting, diarrhea</strong>, depression, <strong>tremors, elevated body temperature</strong>, seizures, and <strong>even death</strong>. As such, we encourage you to avoid feeding salt-heavy snacks like potato chips, pretzels, and salted popcorn to your dog. </p>\n<h1>12. Xylitol</h1>\n<p>Xylitol is used as a sweetener in many products, including gum, candy, baked goods, and toothpaste. It can cause insulin release in dogs, which can lead to <strong>liver failure</strong>. </p>\n<p>The increase in insulin leads to hypoglycemia (lowered sugar levels). Initial signs of toxicosis include <strong>vomiting, lethargy, and loss of coordination</strong>. Signs can progress to <strong>seizures</strong>. Elevated liver enzymes and liver failure can be seen within a few days.</p>\n<h1>13. Avocado</h1>\n<p>Avocados contain a substance called persin, which is toxic to dogs and can cause vomiting and diarrhea.</p>\n<h1>14. Cherries</h1>\n<p>Cherry pits contain cyanide, which is poisonous. They can also be a choking hazard or block the intestines if a dog swallows them.</p>\n<h1>15. Bread dough</h1>\n<p>While bread is generally safe for dogs, the dough can be very dangerous. The yeast in dough can cause it to keep expanding inside the dog’s stomach, which can cause bloating and lead to dangerous complications. The yeast also produces ethanol, and this can cause alcohol poisoning.</p>\n<h1>16. Cinnamon</h1>\n<p>Although not toxic, large amounts of cinnamon can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and liver disease in dogs.</p>\n<p><strong>If you suspect that your dog has ingested dangerous foods, contact your veterinarian immediately.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canines Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}
