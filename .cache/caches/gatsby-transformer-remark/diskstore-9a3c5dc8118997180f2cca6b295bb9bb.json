They contain vitamin A, riboflavin, folate, vitamin B12, iron, selenium, and fatty acids. </p>\n<h2>Are eggs good for dogs?</h2>\n<p>Of course, eggs are also a good source of linoleic acid and fat-soluble vitamins like Vitamin A. All of these are wonderful for a dog’s skin and coat to make it looks shiny and healthy. </p>\n<h2>Are raw eggs bad for dogs?</h2>\n<p>This is a controversial discussion among dog owners. Raw feeders argue for raw eggs, the mixed or non-raw feeders argue for cooked eggs. </p>\n<p>Fact is eggs can be a source for Salmonella and E.Coli and your puppy can get sick. Some foods lose some of their nutritional value when cooked, but this is not the case with eggs. Better safe than sorry, I say. </p>\n<h2>Is eggshell nutritious for dogs?</h2>\n<p>Eggshells contain calcium and phosphorus, so yes eggshell is good for your dog. The shells can also be valuable for dogs who have difficulty eating bones.</p>\n<h2>Is the cholesterol in eggs bad for dogs?</h2>\n<p>A positive thing is that you don’t need to worry about cholesterol in your dog, because cholesterol doesn’t have the same effect in dogs as it does in humans and dogs don’t get to the same cholesterol-related diseases as humans do. That means you don’t need to feed egg whites only.</p>\n<h2>Can dogs eat an egg a day?</h2>\n<p>Eggs are not meant to be eaten every day with every meal. A couple of eggs per week are fine, depending on the size of your dog; less for smaller breeds. Make sure you monitor your dog’s stool in order to see if he tolerates eggs in the first place. If any signs of stomach distress appear stop immediately. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}
