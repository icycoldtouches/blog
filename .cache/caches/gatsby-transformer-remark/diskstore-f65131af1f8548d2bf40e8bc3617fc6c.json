This will generate an aggressive behavior between intact males - male with male interaction -  as well as between intact females - female with female interaction. </p>\n<p>This can lead to a fight between the dogs if, for example, two intact males meet each other and the owners don’t pay attention.</p>\n<h3>Pack Instincts</h3>\n<p>This instinct makes your dog a team player giving the dog a superhero power skill in communication. Due to this instinct, your dog becomes adaptable, a quick learner and a very good observer.</p>\n<h3>Hunting Instincts</h3>\n<p>This instinct ensures the dog the food and water it needs to survive.</p>\n<h3>Territorial Instincts</h3>\n<p>Ohh this is a big one. You can see it at every corner…literally. Together with the sexual instinct, these are the two most common triggers for aggressive behavior.\nThe dog shows this instinct by marking the boundaries of what he thinks it is his territory and by being aggressive towards strangers. Intruders in the territory threaten resources and therefore pose a life-threatening danger.</p>\n<p>Imagine yourself lying in the sun, snoozing off in a comfy chair and all of a sudden you open your eyes and there is a stranger in your garden. To avoid that unpleasant and fear causing situation you build a fence.</p>\n<p>Dogs can not build a fence. They go around their territory and mark it by urinating on bushes,  poles, trees, etc. Notice what your dog does while just going around the corner with it. Most probably pees like 10 times. That is marking territory.</p>\n<p>If you think that the dog’s territory ends at the gates, you are wrong. His territory is also around the corner and two streets down your house as well. So when a human or another dog comes towards your dog and stares at it, what do you think will happen?\nClash of the titans doggy style. </p>\n<p>And here comes our responsibility as dog owners with knowledge: we need to tell and teach our dog how our world and society works. Only we, as responsible dog owners, can give our dog the security and trust it needs to not act territorial and be aggressive.<br>\nAgain it comes down also on the breed you own and the dog’s personality. </p>\n<p>Some dogs are more territorial than others, but with good leadership, you can work and control the behavior. Some breeds, are by their genetics, territorial: Herding and Working dogs, but even Terriers and Hounds. Some examples: German Shepherds, Malinois, Collies, Australian Shepherd, Rottweiler, Bobtail, Sheltie, Newfoundland, Corgi, Kuvasz, etc. </p>\n<h3>Genetics</h3>\n<p>There are probably a zillion doctorate papers on dog genetics, so I am not going to write one in this blog. </p>\n<p>Just keep following things in mind: a dog breed was bred for a specific work. It is in its blood, as they say, to behave, think and react in a certain way. Some behaviors you can not change and you can not reprogram thousand of years of genetics in one dog. </p>\n<h3>Self - Perception, Show - off and Status</h3>\n<p>In some areas we, humans, must admit we do more damage than help. Some dogs can get to think they are the king/queen of the neighborhood just because they do not get the proper boundaries at home. I only say the little prince or princess that throws a fit because another dog dares to cross THEIR path and pee on THEIR grass. </p>\n<p>Same goes also for if your dog has the highest status in the family. I have a question for you: who takes who on a walk? Is it you, the human in lead, or are you being pulled from one tree to another by your dog? </p>\n<p>Some dogs were bullied when they were younger, so they think now “let me be the first that attacks, that way I will not be bullied and that makes me feel good”. What this means is, don’t go with your dog on the street holding in one hand a leash and in the other your phone and expect your dog to behave. You allow your dog to take the lead and be the “grown-up”, protect you and the territory. </p>\n<h3>Lack of Socialisation</h3>\n<p>Some opinion favors the puppy training sessions, some don’t. Bottom line is that you can take your dog to puppy school and still become aggressive and you can not take your puppy to puppy classes and have zero issues or the other way around. YES, you should socialize and train the minute you get your puppy. </p>\n<p>If you missed socialization during the puppy months, you still can socialize your dog at dog parks or on the daily walk. This is not a call for letting your dog loose so that it can run up to every dog it sees. Patience and time come in play here. Go out, sit near a dog park. Observe your dog’s behavior. Find a well behaved and stable dog and make a careful introduction on neutral territory. </p>\n<h3>Boredom</h3>\n<p>Some dogs do get aggressive because they are plain and simple bored. </p>\n<p>Examples of activities that you and your dog can do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Play Fetch with Frisbee, Ball, any other safe toy. Not with sticks or stones.</li>\n<li>Dummy training: make your dog search for its toy or food. </li>\n<li>Hike </li>\n<li>Swim</li>\n<li>Jog</li>\n<li>Bike</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Loss of Control</h3>\n<p>With the loss of control, I mean more or less the loss of freedom - being leashed. Some dogs do have a problem with being leashed because they feel they can not run or protect themselves in case of a threat. This brings us back to the weather you can provide your dog’s basic needs, in this case, safety and trust that you can provide the protection that is needed. </p>\n<p>The moment these dogs get off-leash they assume a controlling behavior by circling, sniffing, imposing, domination behavior towards other dogs, rough “play”. As previously stated, taking the dog off-leash will just allow the dog to solve the situation differently, but it will not solve the cause of the problem.  </p>\n<h3>Low Frustration Threshold</h3>\n<p>Other dogs simply lack patience when they are on a leash to get to where they want to go, get off-leash, go to the other dog, etc. This kind of aggression can backfire towards the owner. Simply do not fulfill all your dog’s wishes. Be also mindful if you do every day the same route and the same exercises. Dogs learn fast when you keep to the same routine and start getting impatient. </p>\n<h3>Hormones</h3>\n<p>The same thing as with humans honestly. One day you have the sweetest kid ever, next day kid can’t stand you. Puberty. Dogs have it too. Impressing other dogs, being rough, eating boundaries, even running away. </p>\n<p>My dog had a best friend. It was a male Ridgeback and they played, ran, swam, ate together. Until they reached puberty. Both of them are intact males and during the walks, they started showing aggressive behavior to the point that their play sometimes turned to rough body checks and growls. The Ridgeback’s owner and I then decided that the two of them are better off walking separately. </p>\n<h3>Food, Toys, and Play Mates</h3>\n<p>Dogs can be or can get possessive. Possessive with owners, food, toys, and even their playmates. Also, this behavior can be well corrected with patience and time. </p>\n<h3>Stress</h3>\n<p>Lack of sleep can cause dog stress and make the dog snap in moments less expected. Some owners take their dogs from dog park to agility training, swim and massage session and end up with a jogging hour. You want to keep the dog busy. Well yes, I get it. A dog needs a job and exercise, but the dog also needs a lot of sleep per day. In my opinion, if it goes over 3h daily workout it stressful. Nothing against the day-long beach or hikes, those activities will not keep your dog in a constant state of excitement.  </p>\n<h3>Insecurity and Fear</h3>\n<p>An insecure dog will try to seam though when on the leash and the moment the owner drops the leash they act as nothing happens or they turn aggressive because an attack is the best defense. </p>\n<p>Fear is the next step of insecurity. While being insecure your dog will try to control the situation, if the dog is fearful it will be flight or fight program. There is no way for you to do exercises, teach the dog if the dog is in a state of fear. There is only the survival instinct that is it. </p>\n<h3>Trauma</h3>\n<p>If dogs could speak… I leave it to that. Trauma happens due to physical or psychological mistreatment induced to the dog by either humans, objects or other animals.  If you know exactly what happened, you can work better in healing the trauma. If you don’t, it will take a while to figure out all the triggers that lead to aggressive behavior. Patience and time. </p>\n<h3>Sickness</h3>\n<p>Chronic pain can cause aggressive behavior. Tumors, accidents, even imbalance in the thyroid can lead to pain thus aggressive behavior. Know where your dog is, what it chews on, where it plays, how it plays. Do yearly check-ups to prevent medical issues and be responsible for what your dog eats. </p>\n<h3>Environmental Influences</h3>\n<p>Environmental influences such as noise, agitation or dogs in the neighborhood can cause stress and thus aggression in dogs. Even wearing a muzzle because it is the law in some countries can lead to aggressive behavior. You try going out on the street with a muzzle. You notice right away people staring at you judgmentally. </p>\n<p>Last but not least people judge a dog by breed, collar even size. Can they be called racists? And of course, the dog knows when people dislike him, stare at him, even hate him at first sight. So that influences his energy.</p>\n<h3>Learned Behaviours</h3>\n<p>As stated before, sticking to the same routine makes a dog learn a certain behavior. If this behavior is repeated a certain amount of time, then your dog will learn it.\nLet’s say your dog is dog reactive and 99% of the dogs have dog tags that make a certain sound. Your dog learns that the sound of the dog tags is another dog, so your dog will react even though it did not see any dog yet. Probably were just your neighbor’s keys. </p>\n<h3>Wrong Associations</h3>\n<p>A dog can associate the pain caused by the corrections done by the owner through a prong collar, e-collar, or just pulling hard on the leash with the incoming dog. So each time a dog comes around, he knows: foreign dog = pain leading to an aggressive reaction. Be mindful with corrections, be gentle and be fair. </p>\n<p>There is no need to be pissed at your dog for 3 hours. Dogs don’t do that. If you look at a mum with pups you will see correcting them with a growl. The action is when it is needed, at the right moment, for that moment. After that, all is good again and everybody is back at being themselves. I understand some human work differently, but wouldn’t be nice to NOT carry that shit around? Just try. </p>\n<h3>Aggressive Environment</h3>\n<p>An aggressive owner leads to an aggressive dog. Remember that dogs are superheroes at observing so they can mirror good out own behavior.\nIn the next blog, I will give you the solutions I worked out in dealing with aggressive dog behavior.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}
