These needs are split up into two categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Dog’s Basic Needs</li>\n<li>A Dog’s Secondary Needs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You probably wonder why your dog needs are split up into two categories. Let me explain this, the basic needs a dog has, are essential for his well-being, security, and survival.\nWithout these, your dog will get all kinds of diseases, he/she will be scared, or in the worst case, your dog dies.</p>\n<p>The secondary needs are there to provide a worthy life for your dog. Think about socializing, exercise, and of course, he/she wants to look good in the mirror too.\nAs you can see are the basic needs of your dog very important for his survival and the secondary needs for his/her happiness, and of course your happiness.</p>\n<p>In this article, I’m going to focus on your dog’s basic needs and why these needs are essential for you as a dog owner and your dog to enjoy life to the fullest. These needs are split up into four categories and are as followed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water</li>\n<li>Food</li>\n<li>Shelter / Heat / Safety</li>\n<li>Access to medical assistance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see they are the same as we humans have. Without these to put it simply you would be thirsty, hungry, cold, warm, wet, scared, or in pain/feeling sick.\nYour secondary needs like socializing with friends/family, having a huge house with a big garden, and looking good in the mirror are not necessary to survive.</p>\n<p>Each need you see above I’m going to explain with more details. You will see that providing these needs is effortless and your dog will be most grateful to you.</p>\n<h2>YOUR DOG’S NEED FOR FRESH WATER</h2>\n<p>Your dog needs fresh and clean water every day.\nThe amount differs with the size of the dog, the amount of activity of the dog and the amount of water and/or salt present in the food.</p>\n<p>The table below shows how much water a dog needs on a certain activity level per lb:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Activity</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weight</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Amount</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Low Activity Level</td>\n<td align=\"center\">per 10 lb</td>\n<td align=\"center\">8.5 fl oz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Medium Activity Level</td>\n<td align=\"center\">per 10 lb</td>\n<td align=\"center\">12.5 fl oz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">High Activity Level</td>\n<td align=\"center\">per 10 lb</td>\n<td align=\"center\">18 fl oz</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But the outside temperature and water and/or salt in your dog’s food have to be kept in mind too. To help you out I created a nice calculator were you have to select your dog’s activity level and put in his weight.</p>\n<p>The results are rounded up “giving extra water doesn’t harm your dog” and on summer days when the sun comes out that extra water will make sure he has enough.\nHaving clean and fresh drinking water for your dog is important for the health and well-being of the dog. So your dog must always have access to clean drinking water in a sufficient amount.</p>\n<p>Most dogs that are kept by us have a plastic, metal or stone water bowl in their living room.</p>\n<p>It is important that there is always enough water in this bowl for the dog.\nThe water bowl will also have to be regularly rinsed or completely cleaned because a mucus layer will appear in the bottom of the bowl in which bacteria will settle that damage the water quality and eventually your pooches health.</p>\n<h2>TAKING CARE OF YOUR DOG BY FEEDING HIM</h2>\n<p>Another basic requirement for dogs is food. A dog needs daily food that is fed in a sufficient amount of healthy food that is suitable for the species and age in a way that suits the dog’s stage of development.</p>\n<p>The amount of food depends on the age, activity, and size of the dog. A dog that is still growing or undertakes many activities or is pregnant will need more food than a dog that lazes around all day.</p>\n<p>These dogs also often have a greater need for other nutrients (<em>eg: high proteins</em> ) or in other proportions. These guidelines can often be found on the packaging or obtained on the advice of the vet.</p>\n<p>It is therefore important to always keep a close eye on things to prevent overweight, underweight or mineral deficiencies.</p>\n<p>Most dogs are fed kibble, although there are also dogs that live on raw meat, cooked food or food scraps. Whatever diet the dog receives, it is important to give the dog a high-quality food to ensure the health of the dog.</p>\n<p>For most dog foods developed by the manufacturer, all important nutrients are already present in the food in the correct amount.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this often does not apply to cheaper food.\nIf a dog is fed homemade food or food scraps, it is important to have good knowledge of quantities, necessary nutrients, and food that must be avoided at all times.</p>\n<p>A dog is not a person and has different needs than us. There are also products that we eat every day and that can make a dog sick and die in the worst case.</p>\n<h2>PROVIDING WARMTH AND SHELTER TO YOUR DOG</h2>\n<p>A dog must be protected against adverse weather conditions and cold. The space in which your dog resides must be sufficiently lit and darkened.</p>\n<p>This is important to meet the ethological and physiological needs of your dog.\nThis space must not contain any objects with sharp edges or protrusions that could cause your dog to injure itself. It is also important that if materials are used, they are not harmful to your dog and must be easy to clean and disinfect.</p>\n<p>It is also important that your dog has sufficient freedom of movement.\nMost dogs will be kept inside the house, but of course, there are dogs that stay often outside, in a kennel, on a lead or completely loose.</p>\n<p>If your dog is staying outside and has been fixed, it is important that the collar is designed in such a way that no strangulation or injury can occur to your dog.\nThe chain or rope that is used must be of a length that your dog can move freely and this freedom of movement must be free of obstacles.</p>\n<p>When you keep your dog outside it is also important that your pooch can seek shelter from heat, cold, rain and wind or have a nice place to sleep. Most people will choose a doghouse to provide this shelter/sleeping place.</p>\n<p>When choosing or building a dog house you want to make sure that your dog has enough space. Some minimal requirements for a doghouse are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Height:</strong> 1,5 x the height of your dog.</li>\n<li><strong>Width:</strong> 1,0 x the height of your dog.</li>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 1,5 x the length of your dog.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s best to lift the doghouse at least 10 cm above the ground to prevent moisture from getting in the house.</p>\n<p>One must also avoid drafts in the loft by means of a draft partition that must be placed between the entrance and the sleeping area from floor to ceiling.\nSome people will also go for an outdoor dog kennel.</p>\n<p>These kennels are mostly with a cover on top to protect your dog from the elements. They are also a lot bigger in size and fenced off so your dog has an outdoor place to eat, drink, play, and sleep.</p>\n<p>In winters it’s important that the drinking water doesn’t freeze, your dog always needs access to clean fresh drinking water.</p>\n<h2>MEDICAL CARE FOR YOUR DOG</h2>\n<p>Your dog must also be safe and protected against injury or illness. Your dog should also, if necessary, have access to medical help to combat ailments.\nIf a dog is sick or injured, a veterinarian must be called in to treat your dog.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>As you learned in this article, water (to stay hydrated), food (for energy and a healthy body), shelter (for warmth, shade, and protection against rain/snow/wind), and medical assistance (to treat injuries/sickness) are of great importance for your dog’s wellbeing and survival.</p>\n<p>The things we described are the minimal recommendations and can be followed but in order to give your dog a happy and secure life, it needs these basics.\nIn ( A Dog’s Secondary Needs ), I explain the secondary necessities like social needs, sufficient freedom of movement and activity, external care, the ability to practice species-specific behavior and clarity regarding norms and values.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}
