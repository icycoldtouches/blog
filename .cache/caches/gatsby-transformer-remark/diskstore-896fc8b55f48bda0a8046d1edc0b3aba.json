He also does not know that he is ungrateful when he behaves badly, although you love him so much, provide shelter, food, and water.</p>\n<p>A dog doesn’t know what is allowed and what is forbidden, good or bad in the same way we understand these words.</p>\n<p>A dog basically only differentiates between safe and dangerous. Don’t take this personally, not blame your dog for this kind of behavior. This is how dogs simply are.\nDogs don’t make their behaviour dependent on how you feel about certain things and behaviors, only on what brings immediate advantage or disadvantage to himself. </p>\n<p>This means, yes your dog loves you in his own way and whatever he does it is not because he wants to annoy you, plots a revenge or wants to conquer and rule the world.</p>\n<p>The magic formula is:</p>\n<p><strong>Command –> Wanted Behavior –> Marker –> Reward.</strong></p>\n<h2>So how can you successfully communicate to your dog what is good and what is bad?</h2>\n<p>There are several methods, and these methods find their roots in the behavioural psychology. </p>\n<h2>Conditioning Dog Training</h2>\n<p>The conditioning is a type of learning that linked with a sort of stimulus leads to a behaviour and response. </p>\n<p>The behavioural science makes a distinction between classical and operant conditioning. </p>\n<h3>Classical Conditioning Dog Training</h3>\n<p>Classical conditioning involves forming an association between a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus that naturally and automatically produces a response. </p>\n<p>Salivating in response to the smell of dinner cooking in the oven is an example of unconditioned stimuli. Your response to these things takes place automatically without any learning, thus the name of unconditioned response.</p>\n<p>There are 3 phases to the classical conditioning:</p>\n<h4>Before Conditioning</h4>\n<p>A naturally occurring stimulus will automatically elicit a response.\nKeeping to the same example as above: salivating in response to the smell of food is a good example of a naturally occurring stimulus.\nDuring this phase of the classical conditioning, the <em>unconditioned stimulus</em> (smell of food) results in an <em>unconditioned response</em> (salivating).</p>\n<h4>During Conditioning</h4>\n<p>A <em>neutral stimulus</em>is included in the equation and <strong>repeatedly paired</strong> with the <em>unconditioned stimulus</em>.\nTaking the example of Pavlov’s dog: each time the dog received food a bell rang. </p>\n<h4>After Conditioning</h4>\n<p>Once the association between the <em>neural stimulus</em> and the <em>unconditioned stimulus</em> has been established, presenting now the conditioned stimulus alone will evoke a response even without the unconditioned stimulus. The resulting response is known as the <em>conditioned response</em>.</p>\n<p>Coming back to Pavlov’s dog: the sound of the bell (<em>neutral stimulus</em>) was repeatedly paired with presenting the food bowl (<em>unconditioned stimulus</em>) to the dog. When Pavlov only rang the bell (<em>neutral stimulus</em>), without presenting the food bowl, the dog started salivating (<em>conditioned response</em>).</p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5jGmFQ6hckQDy65npzBhzJ/9cca66d45adffe86e85fcd5757887de1/IMG_0154.png\" alt=\"IMG 0154\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h3>Operant Conditioning Dog Training</h3>\n<p>Operant Conditioning is a method of learning that occurs through rewards and punishments for a behavior. An association is made between a behavior and a consequence for that behavior.</p>\n<p>Operant conditioning relies on a fairly simple premise - actions that are followed by reinforcement will be strengthened and more likely to occur again in the future.\nConversely, actions that result in punishment or undesirable consequences will be weakened and less likely to occur again in the future.</p>\n<h2>What is Conditioning Dog Training?</h2>\n<p><strong>Classical Conditioning</strong> is a pretty straight forward way of teaching your dog a certain behavior and response to a stimulus. </p>\n<p>By linking sounds, gestures and event together your dog learns to respond to auditory or visual signs and to understand the meaning of certain gestures, words or situations.\nExisting links become weaker with time if they are not constantly refreshed. </p>\n<p>Lets say your dog barks each time the doorbell rings. Well, if you press the doorbell a hundred times without anyone coming, your dog will barely react to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Operant Conditioning</strong> is the method best described: trial and error. When your dog has a goal, he will try different behaviours like barking, jumping, sitting, standing still, scratching, etc until he sees that one behaviour give him what he wants.</p>\n<p>Example: your dog is playing with his ball and this rolled under the sofa. Now he wants his ball back, but he can not reach it. He will try pawing, scratching, pulling, whining, nudging your with his nose and whatever facilitates his way to the ball he will remember. </p>\n<p>Let's say you stood up and took the ball out and gave back to him. Now he knows: balls under sofa, go nudge and human will get the ball. </p>\n<h2>How To Train Your Dog?</h2>\n<p>The answer lays in combining the two conditioning trainings. Classical and operant conditioning are both important learning concepts that originated in behavioural psychology. </p>\n<p>The operant conditioning, however, lays the foundation for the reinforcement training method.</p>\n<h3>Reinforcement Dog Training</h3>\n<p>You can understand negative and positive in dog training by their  mathematical meaning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Positive means something is added to the dog</li>\n<li>Negative means something is subtracted (taken away) from the dog</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These terms refer to what is happening around the dog as consequences of the dogs behaviour.</p>\n<h4>Positive Reinforcement Dog Training</h4>\n<p>A favorable event or outcome presents itself after a certain behavior. </p>\n<p>In situations that reflect positive reinforcement, a response or behavior is strengthened by the addition of something, such as praise or a direct reward. </p>\n<p>Positive reinforcement is giving a reward (attention, food, touch, play) immediately following a behavior that you like and want to see more often. This way your dog learns that good things happen to him when he does certain things only. </p>\n<p>Positive reinforcement teaching techniques use non confrontational methods to work your dog’s brain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rewarding positive behavior</li>\n<li>establishing rituals that enables your dog to provide a good and wanted behavior (setting him up for success) </li>\n<li>establishing training that enables your dog to provide a good and wanted behavior (setting him up for success)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using positive techniques to change undesirable behavior requires that you first determine the cause of the behavior and then figure out how to modify and change it by giving the dog the ability to learn, feel safe and prevent situations that will lead to the unwanted behavior.  </p>\n<p>People learn to connect with their dogs and work through problems in a human manner – strengthening the relationship by fostering mutual trust, providing affection, and encouraging cooperation.</p>\n<p>Timing is crucial when delivering rewards for behavior, this means <strong>the reward needs to come within seconds of the good behavior.</strong> </p>\n<h2>Positive Reinforcement Dog Training Rules:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Avoid intimidation, physical punishment and/or fear.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Studies show that if you use punishing training methods, your dog will not work out of desire and joy, but it will even lead to either more aggressiveness or fearfulness from the dog. Simply put, if you are trying to fight fire with fire someone will get burned.</p>\n<p>“Old school” training methods that promote punishments, will argue that jabbing the dog’s ribs, or yanking the leash, or using electric shock will not particularly damage the dog. It is up to you honestly if you wish to use this kind of methods, but there is no excuse for causing another living being pain. </p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Understand dominance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The most important thing for you as dog owner to understand is that your dog's misbehavior is actually very rarely a result of an attempt for him to assert dominance over you. Nor does your dog thrive for world domination in his spare time.</p>\n<p>Dog behaviour issues arise because owners have no idea how to communicate and how to understand their dog and from a misbalance in safety, trust and guidance between dog owner and dog. </p>\n<p>And no, your dog is not a wolf. He might have wolves as very far away ancestors, but evolution did make big changes in a dog’s behavior. </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Change perspective: see it from the dog’s point of view.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Dogs communicate using a complex language of body signals that reflect what they are thinking and feeling. </p>\n<p>They use these signals consciously and unconsciously to communicate intent and ensure their personal safety by affecting behavior in others.</p>\n<p>It is our responsibility as dog owners to learn the body language of our dogs in order to live in balance and harmony. </p>\n<h4>Negative Reinforcement Dog Training</h4>\n<p>The removal of an unfavorable event or outcome after the display of a behavior.\nIn situations that reflect negative reinforcement, a response or behavior is strengthened by subtracting (removing) something considered unpleasant.</p>\n<p>One example of negative reinforcement is when the dog’s hips are pushed downwards to force the dog into a sit, and then released once the dog is in a sit. Assuming the behaviour of sitting goes up in frequency, the behaviour was negatively reinforced by the removal of the pressure on the dog’s hips.</p>\n<p>In a study about aggression in dogs conducted by R. A. Casey, the use of positive punishment and/or negative reinforcement was associated with an increased risk of aggression of 2.9 times for aggression towards family members, and 2.2 times towards unfamiliar people outside of the house. In this study barking, lunging, growling, and biting were all considered to be aggression.</p>\n<p>The study of Deldalle and Gaunet looked specifically at the use of negative reinforcement in dog training.</p>\n<p>This study compared dogs taking an advanced dog training class at two different schools: one that used positive reinforcement and one that used negative reinforcement. The dogs had already completed a basic dog training class at the same school.</p>\n<p>Negative reinforcement was used to teach loose leash walking by tugging on the leash while the dog was at a distance from the owner, and stopping tugging when the dog was close by. </p>\n<p>Sit was taught by both pulling the leash up and pushing the dog’s bottom down and only releasing when the dog was in the sit position. </p>\n<p>Positive reinforcement was used to reward the dog for doing the right behaviour, whenever the dog shows it by itself without using any form or coercion.</p>\n<p>The results showed that dogs in the negative reinforcement group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rarely looked at their owners when walking on leash, compared to those taught with positive reinforcement.</li>\n<li>Showed more mouth licks and yawns when practicing the ‘sit’ command, and were more likely to have a low body posture, all signs of stress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The study concludes that training dogs with positive reinforcement is better for the human-canine relationship than using negative reinforcement.</strong></p>\n<h4>Positive Punishment Dog Training</h4>\n<p>Known as punishment by addition, this form of punishment represents the addition of an unfavorable event or outcome in order to weaken certain behaviour.  </p>\n<p>So positive punishment means adding a punishment (and by no means I mean inflicting ANY kind of violence) after the dog did a behaviour that makes the frequency of that behaviour go down.</p>\n<p>In everyday language, some of the positive punishments get called “corrections”. For example, tugging on the leash because the dog did not sit when you asked him to. You added pressure to the leash, i.e. collar.</p>\n<p>The  study of Herron, Reisner, and Shofer found an aggressive response from the dog when people use positive punishment: 11% of dogs when use of a prong or choke collar was applied; 15% when the owner yelled “no” at his dog, and 43% when the owner hit or kicked his dog.</p>\n<p>The use of aversive training techniques is a risk factor for aggression towards strangers and family members shows the research of R. A. Casey.</p>\n<p>And the thing that surprises some people the most is that people who report having used positive punishment to train their dog are more likely to report problem behaviours (Hiby, Rooney and Bradshaw).</p>\n<p>According to the research conducted by Emily J Blackwell people who used a shock collar report less successful training than they expected.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the European College of Veterinary Clinical Ethologists issued a position statement calling for electronic collars to be banned across Europe. </p>\n<p>The American Veterinary Society for Animal Behaviour says <em>“Research shows that dogs do not need to be physically punished to learn how to behave, and there are significant risks associated with using punishment (such as inhibiting learning, increasing fear, and/or stimulating aggressive events).</em></p>\n<p><em>Therefore, trainers who routinely use choke collars, pinch collars, shock collars, and other methods of physical punishment as a primary training method should be avoided.”</em></p>\n<h4>Negative Punishment Dog Training</h4>\n<p>Known as punishment by subtraction (removal), this form of punishment occurs when a favorable event or outcome is removed after a behavior occurs. </p>\n<p>Negative punishment is done by removing something the dog values, thus decreasing the possibility of the dogs behavior repeating in the future. </p>\n<p>A good example is neglecting to give the dog attention when he jumps on you, where “attention” is what you’re taking away from the dog. Negative punishment is much more effective for this problem behavior. </p>\n<p>The dog jumps up, you <strong>remove</strong> yourself (and your attention), and the behavior decreases because there is no reward. You can easily take a step backwards and turn away from your dog when he jumps up. </p>\n<p><strong>Negative punishment should not disrupt the bond you have with your pet.</strong> </p>\n<p>When you withdraw your attention, or yourself, in response to a “bad” behavior, do so for not much more than a minute. Prolonged social isolation may cause stress and anxiety. </p>\n<p>As with positive reinforcement, timing is important. You must remove the rewarding stimulus within a few seconds of when the behavior occurred.  </p>\n<p>Another issue is <em>human inconsistency.</em> Your dog’s brain can not deal with inconsistencies.</p>\n<p>For example one day it is raining outside, so you had to wash your dog after your walk. If your dog is always allowed on the sofa, but now, because he is wet, he is not allowed, you will just confuse the heck out of him. In his eyes you will be unpredictable and he might become fearful of your reactions.</p>\n<p>The solution is to think ahead in the beginning, create rules and boundaries that you can be consistent with. If you like to cuddle on the sofa, well if he is wet place 1-2 blankets and be fine with that. </p>\n<h2>The Marker In Dog Training</h2>\n<p>In dog training you will often hear trainers talk about \"marking a behavior\".  <strong>Marking</strong> is when you send a signal to a dog that will be associated with whatever behavior that was just performed. </p>\n<p>The signal will be used to either encourage or discourage that behavior.\nWhen the signal is used to encourage a behavior it is called a \"positive marker” and when it is used to discourage a behavior it is called a “negative marker”. </p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5sbF7KCTPNAhDomvjER61E/c72a89d2606b972ffe056b52912e5edb/_MG_5542.jpeg\" alt=\"MG 5542\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h3>Positive Markers In Dog Training</h3>\n<p>Positive markers are any sounds that tell your dog that he did a great job. You can either use a word or a clicker for this. </p>\n<p>Word like “Good dog\", \"YES!\", \"YIP\", a clicking sound with your tongue or any other word you can think of ca be used as a positive marker. </p>\n<p>If you want to use a word as your Marker, make sure it is short and sharp, and it comes naturally to you when you are pleased. </p>\n<p>The marker word shouldn’t be similar to your dog’s name and also shouldn’t be a word you use 100 time a day. That will just confuse your dog.</p>\n<p>The little plasticky device that makes a distinct and sharp noise it called a clicker.\nA clicker is a great tool because it has all the above characteristics. But it is a device you must take with you when you want to train. </p>\n<p>The great advantage is that the sound is unique to your dog and can not be misused or confused and it is consistent in tone and length.</p>\n<h4>How To Teach Your Dog The Marker</h4>\n<p>This is going to be the easiest thing you ever thought your dog!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wait for your dog to display wanted behaviour.</li>\n<li>Mark the wanted behavior by saying the marker word (or click with the clicker).</li>\n<li>Immediately give your dog a treat.</li>\n<li>You know your dog got it when he looks at you waiting for the treat after the sound occurred. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>See this article to learn <strong>clicker dog training</strong> in depth. </p>\n<h3>Negative Markers In Dog Training</h3>\n<p>Negative markers are used to discourage and dissolve unwanted dog behavior. Examples for negative markers are words like “NO”, “AH-AH”. The tone is firm and leaves no room for “maybe”. </p>\n<p>Eventually the negative marker by itself will serve as a conditioned punisher and the dog will restrain from the unwanted behavior when hearing the word used by his owner because of its close association with undesirable consequences: loss of attention, loss of play time, no treats.</p>\n<h2>The Classical Marker Dog Training</h2>\n<p>The classical clicker dog training happens when the trainer tells the dog what to do and the dog performs that command correctly and the behavior is marked and rewarded. </p>\n<p>This requires that the command is already known by dog upfront in order for him to able to provide it. This method can be used more for reinforcing an already known behavior rather than teaching it all new. </p>\n<h2>The Operant Marker Dog Training</h2>\n<p>Contrary to the classical marker dog training, during the operant marked dog training the trainer awaits for the dog to display, even offer, certain behaviors. The desired behaviours will give the dog rewards, the unwanted ones give him nothing or negative punishment (“ignoring” is applied). </p>\n<p>This form of training allows dogs to be active during training sessions, rather than only have them be ordered around. This doesn’t mean that the classical method is wrong. It depends a lot on your dog’s temperament and how he reacts to the training methods. So just be open to both ways and try it out. </p>\n<h2>The Continuation Marker Dog Training</h2>\n<p>The Continuation Marker Dog Training signals the dog to keep doing what he is doing.\nSay you want to teach your dog to fetch his leash prior to the walk. This is a complex series of actins your dog needs to learn. You first break down the action in little exercises and then start linking them together. Once you have a small link, you will stop rewarding each small step alone and switch to reward a chain of actions. </p>\n<p>Some dogs need reassurance that they are doing it right, so you can start using a continuation marker, like “yeeeeees”, “gooood”. When you use the continuation marker word you say it a happy, prolonged intonation and when the chain of actions id done you use your normal marker with the same tone and intensity as you normally do, or use the clicker. </p>\n<h2>The Reward In Dog Training</h2>\n<p>Remember the magic formula Command –> Wanted Behavior –> Marker –> Reward?\nNow is the fun time for your dog: the oh so awaited and wanted reward. Reward is the currency in the dog world. Learn what currency your dog’s bank desires the most, and you set yourself and your dog up for success. This is called a high value reward. </p>\n<p>Using low value rewards, will not keep your dog as excited as you want during the training sessions. Low value rewards will demotivate and even lead the dog to be bored and go roam and chase squirrels. </p>\n<p>The key is to find out what your dog likes. Some dogs just love food and you can train awesomely a life long with chicken, or high quality dog treats. Other dogs put their preference on toys or human attention. </p>\n<p>But wait, stop for a moment and analyse your dog’s life style! Yes, I said lifestyle! Some of us have only 1 dog, and he gets fed twice a day, gets tons of cuddles and has toys laying around. What is his currency now? Once you leave the house it is all about the squirrels, cats, other dogs, rest of environment, and pretty much far away from you. This is when Fluffy decides not to return to your when recalled; sorry to say, but in your dog’s eyes you are boring. </p>\n<p>What happens if you change his life style and remove some of the luxuries? I am not talking about not feeding him, or leave zero toys around, or give no attention to your dog at all. For example find that one toy he is crazy about and use it only for training and only when you and your dog are playing together. This is not a toy to share with other dogs. This is the bond between you and him.  </p>\n<h3>How To Give A Reward During Dog Training?</h3>\n<p>What you should avoid is delivering the reward right into the dog’s face every time. This may become boring or even frustrating for a dog if your training wasn’t properly planned and the dog is having issues figuring out what he is supposed to do. </p>\n<p>Because of this, the whole concept may end up being about the treats themselves, instead of being about the interaction with you. </p>\n<p>Regardless of the type of reward, make it an event every time you can when delivering it. After all, that is why it is called a “reward”.</p>\n<h4>Attention</h4>\n<p>Attention is a good reward to use in between bigger rewards. Remember the chain of actions? Use it in between, use it e.g. when you dog is free and he comes to you without you asking him to. Be friendly, use a soft voice, smile and pet your dog. </p>\n<p>Make sure you know where your dog likes to be touched. Not all dogs like to be touched on top of their head, like 99,99% of the people do. By avoiding the unwanted spot you show respect towards your dog and he will trust you even more. </p>\n<h4>Toy</h4>\n<p>As stated above, here we talk about THE toy. The one piece of equipment that makes your dog wag his tail and be super happy when you take it out. C’mon, you all know that behavior. </p>\n<p>So how do you give the toy to the dog? You don’t just walk and throw it to his paws. No. The toy needs to be earned. </p>\n<p>In your mind return to the classical and/or operant marker dog training. The moment your dog does what you want (either a command or he offers a certain behavior by himself), mark and reward with the toy. </p>\n<p>The toy reward is delivered in such a way that the dog has to catch it in the air, simulating catching a prey. This is a very important part of delivery since it builds satisfaction and motivation for your dog.</p>\n<p>After he caught the toy, maybe lay a couple of seconds (especially it is a tug toy), after that he needs to return the toy to you. This way the toy needs to be earned each time. </p>\n<p>After the training session is done, I personally allow my dog to carry his earning to the car, rest place or until home. He feels really proud doing that and it is a reinforcement for his awesome behavior. Once he is at his place, car, home, etc that toy disappears until the next training session. </p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/2mJlsi1HUkxdySDPxXQkgB/0ea10cafa17e25d248bf221d3318fc6a/_MG_9594.jpeg\" alt=\"MG 9594\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<h4>Food</h4>\n<p>High value food rewards are meat, cheese, dog food sausages, etc. Normally, high value treats are soft products, although this depends on your dog. </p>\n<p>Every dog has a different taste and what some dogs may find extremely motivating, another may not and even spit it out. You may have to change a few different types of reward treats in order to find what your dog prefers the most.</p>\n<p>Administrating the food reward is similar to how the toy is given, without the play part. </p>\n<h2>Dog Training Guidelines</h2>\n<p>The process of changing a dog’s behavior using positive reinforcement relies first and foremost on understanding, patience, consistency, and a good amount of repetitions.</p>\n<p>Take into account that puppies have a very short attention span, so make the training sessions short and pleasant. NEVER EVER end a training session with an incorrectly done exercise or any bad mood or angry tone. The last that happens is what your dog will remember and associate with. </p>\n<p>From the age of six weeks, the learning ability of a puppy is fully developed and ready to absorb your teachings like a sponge. </p>\n<h2>Best Dog Training Guidelines</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Identify</strong> why your dog is doing what he is doing. You cannot effectively deal with a behavior unless you know the root cause.</li>\n<li>Once you know why, then you can ask yourself how to treat the behavior. To do this, it is vitally important you <strong>understand</strong> your dog.</li>\n<li>Figure out how to communicate clearly. <strong>Effective communication</strong> increases the bond between you.</li>\n<li>Find what <strong>motivates</strong> your dog and use this while teaching. Rewards in the form of food, toys, praise, or play are powerful, but every dog is different, so find out what motivates your dog the most.</li>\n<li>Never hit, scream at, or yank your dog. Do not combat fear with more fear—recognize your dog’s concerns, then slowly and gently help her overcome them. You wouldn’t like to be treated like that either, so <strong>be kind</strong>. </li>\n<li>Go slow and be <strong>patient</strong> when dealing with anxiety-related behaviors and allow your dog the <strong>time</strong> he needs to bond and come out of his cocoon.</li>\n<li>Everyone in your dog’s life must be on the same page and provide <strong>consistency</strong> in training, expectations and reactions. If one person lets your dog on the couch and someone else does not, he will get confused.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}
