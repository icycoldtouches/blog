Although you can also find good harnesses made of leather, it will cost you more money. Harnesses, when chosen wisely, will last you very long as well, so it might be worth the investment.</p>\n<p>Depending on your dog's fur you can choose either a more protective one (with more material) or a more simple one (material is present mainly on the straps).</p>\n<h3>Width</h3>\n<p>Width is for me one of the main criteria according to which I chose the daily collar for my dog. The width I prefer is minumum 1in (2,5cm).</p>\n<p>For the harness, I chose also a roundabout 1in (2,5cm) width for the straps.</p>\n<h3>Comfort</h3>\n<p>Make sure that the flat collar of your choice has padding all around the inside of the collar, as well as a protective flap for the buckle. I like the collars to have a separate ring for the dog tags as well. </p>\n<p>A comfortable harness will not press on your dog's ness when he is sniffing, and will not create friction between his front legs and strap when walking or running. This means that it is more preferable to have a Y-shaped harness in the front and a good clearance for the dog's front legs.</p>\n<p>Watch out with overheating in summer if you use a harness.</p>\n<h3>How tight should a dog collar or harness be?</h3>\n<p>After you put the collar on your dog’s neck slip two fingers between the dog’s neck and collar to ensure that it is not too tight. The same measurements I take for the harness as well.</p>\n<p>A poorly-fitting collar can affect your dog’s eating, drinking and even breathing, which will obviously lead to catastrophic outcomes. A collar that’s to stiff (like the ones one made from untreated leather) can also cause irritation to the dog’s neck. </p>\n<h2>Best Dog Collars and Harnesses 2020 - Dog Collar and Harness Types</h2>\n<h3>Choke Collars</h3>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/OLNWa4z6Afd3SI6MkHkz2/1ecf83716ac5846b1556aad39cef45a9/choke_collar.jpg\" alt=\"choke collar\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<p>In essence, these collars are chains that contract and expand, exerting pressure on your dog’s neck.</p>\n<h3>E-Collars</h3>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/276FdKS1Htgto4vkivoi2T/1b4270185b5ff799abaca7239e69cfe6/e-collar.jpg\" alt=\"e-collar\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<p>E-collars (electronic collars) deliver a mild to moderate pulse to a dog. </p>\n<h3>Martingale Collars</h3>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/71va3z7X7IPIfygHuz04tC/a88cc8f83090e4da0254a7a3ded9ae33/martingale-collar.jpg\" alt=\"martingale-collar\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<p>A martingale collar is made of two loops: one that fits around the dog’s neck and another (the control loop) that attaches to a leash. Because of this construction, it functions much like a choke collar but doesn’t put the same kind of pressure on the trachea.</p>\n<h3>Prong Collars</h3>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/5AcbdLZQGwEDVtOK5Yo78B/47e391638a122ad4f95367a085fd6967/prong_collar.jpg\" alt=\"prong collar\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<p>Prong or pinch collars are similar in design to choke collars, except instead of the links being curved and smooth, an open piece of metal extends beyond the link and pinches the dog’s neck.</p>\n<h3>Flat Collars</h3>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/UKtAMfj8lyW9jbqtXO8My/307ad1d679bf648300fbd066652dd064/dog-collar.jpg\" alt=\"dog-collar\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<p>A flat collar is similar to a  human belt. It serves well as a means to maintain positive control of your pet.</p>\n<p>Flat collars are the most common collars worldwide. Almost every dog will wear a flat collar at some point in his life, whether during his puppy years or all the time. They come in an array of options, so it is important to choose the right one for your dog’s size and make it fit correctly. </p>\n<p>Most of the time you will use one collar that you and your dog will accept the best. Take your time in choosing it and instead of investing in 2-3 collars, make a bigger investment in 1 good one. </p>\n<h3>Front-Clip Harness</h3>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/57W56xFCICBHhDNMBXQXnH/991b4b06d7ab4c46ae9b59ac6f786e8d/fron_clip_harness_1.jpg\" alt=\"fron clip harness 1\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<p>A front-clip harness allows you to hook the leash in front of the sternum (chest bone) of the dog.</p>\n<p>The purpose of a front clip harness is to provide you with extra control over your dog. When your dog pulls towards something, the front leash attachment point causes them to pivot around towards you the moment you pull on the leash.  </p>\n<h3>Back-Clip Harness</h3>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/4ORu5EMfe1KMPpAJcn1u6r/64226d050229d1830a493e0137800f4d/harness-fun-black-black-l.jpg\" alt=\"harness-fun-black-black-l\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<p>A back-clip harness allows you to hook the leash at the back of the harness right on top of the mid-back or between the shoulder blades of your dog.\nThe harnesses are especially useful for small dogs with delicate throats easily damaged by collars. </p>\n<p>I have 3 circumstances when I use the above-pictured harness on my dog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When I take my dog for hikes and I don’t know the terrain. It is easier to pull out a dog from a ditch by the harness than by the collar or skin.</li>\n<li>When I take my dog alongside my bicycle. I don’t want to accidentally yank his neck with the bike.</li>\n<li>When I have my dog in the car and I use the seatbelt option. Again I don’t want him to be yanked by his neck in case of a strong brake.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When back-clip harnesses are used with an untrained dog who likes to pull, they create a sled-pulling action, with the owner dragged along in place of the sled. And believe me, dogs are strong :-). </p>\n<h2>Top 4 Best Dog Collars and Harnesses 2020 - What Should You Buy?</h2>\n<p>For safety reasons, I will not describe nor advertise the use of the choke, electronic, martingale or prong collars. In my opinion, if you think you need to use one of the above, you should consult a professional that can show you how to work with those collars… if really necessary. </p>\n<p>I have a reactive dog as well and I only use a flat collar for our normal walks and I can still correct my dog with my voice to not react. It is because we developed a bond and relationship that allows me to do that. </p>\n<h3>Flat Collar - PawFurEver Soft &#x26; Breathable Padded Leather Dog Collar</h3>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/UKtAMfj8lyW9jbqtXO8My/307ad1d679bf648300fbd066652dd064/dog-collar.jpg\" alt=\"dog-collar\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<ul>\n<li>100% Genuine Leather and Comfort: PawFurEver’s handmade real leather dog collar gives your dog a stylish designer look with all the comfort that they deserve.
