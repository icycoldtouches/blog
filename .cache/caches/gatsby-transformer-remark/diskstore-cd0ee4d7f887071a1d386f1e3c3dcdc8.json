How did we come to this conclusion? We looked at ingredients (no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives), DMB(P), price, made in a country with high quality and safety standards the food is manufactured (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Western Europe) and reviews.</p>\n<p>As with all reviews, there are people claiming the dog food is bad and harms your dog but this is not always true. As we explained in our article High Protein Dog Food, not every dog is created equally and therefore your dog might get an allergic reaction to the food.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we didn’t weigh the reviews that heavily instead we checked some claims people made about the brand to see if they were true or not. What we found is that people also leave negative reviews when their dog gets an allergic reaction to the food but in our eyes, that’s not the manufacturer’s fault. Your dog is just allergic to a particular ingredient and therefore you should watch your dog’s health.</p>\n<h2>1.

Just like Blue Wilderness CRAVE is also grain-free and more affordable if you’re looking for cheaper dog food.
