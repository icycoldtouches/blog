This is a happy medium length that gives your dog some space to roam but isn’t so long that it’s hard to keep your dog close. If you usually walk your dog on busy city streets, a shorter 4 ft (1m) option is preferable, as it’s easier to keep your dog close. Long 10 or 15 ft (3m or 5m) leashed are best suited to walking in parks or on hiking trails.</p>\n<h3>Width</h3>\n<p>The wider the leash, the stronger it is, so make sure you choose a leash wide enough for the size of your dog. A half-inch (1cm) leash might be fine for walking small dogs but look for an option of at least an inch (2,5cm) wide from medium or large dogs.</p>\n<h3>Comfort</h3>\n<p>Hold it, try it and you will feel what is right for you. For me, an inch (2,5cm) wide leash feels better than the slip lead I own simply because of the material it is made of. I like sturdy materials, that don’t get slippery and cut into my hand if they get wet.</p>\n<h2>Best Dog Leashes In 2020 - Types of Dog Leashes</h2>\n<h3>Standard Leashes</h3>\n<p>Standard leashes have a loop handle at one end and a metal clip at the other end to attach to your dog's collar. These leashes are intended to use on a daily basis and during training. </p>\n<p>Typically available in lengths from 4 to 8 ft (approx. 1 - 2,5m). I personally use a standard 8ft (2,5m) leash only when I go out for potty purposes with my dog. I use a 4ft (1m) leash for our city walks. </p>\n<p>Standard leashes are most commonly flat. Flat leashes come in various widths, usually getting wider and thicker for larger and stronger dogs. </p>\n<h3>Tow Leashes</h3>\n<p>Important and effective when you want to teach your dog to walk off-leash.\nTow leashes are similar to standard leashes just much longer 16 to 32 ft (5-10m), so pick whatever you feel comfortable with. Some may have a loop handle some may not. </p>\n<h3>Adjustable Leashes</h3>\n<p>Adjustable leashes have one or multiple loops along the leash that allows a clasp to shorten or lengthen the leash.</p>\n<p>You may want to use an adjustable leash to wrap it around your waist or torso. Commonly used by those owners that jog with their dogs.</p>\n<h3>Slip Leads for Dogs</h3>\n<p>Slip leads are two-in-one collar and leash. The leash loops onto itself and goes over the dog’s head.</p>\n<p>If your dog pulls on the leash, the collar part will tighten. This can be dangerous since it can suffocate your dog if it tightens up too much, similar to choke collars. Also, be aware that your dog may be able to loosen the area around the neck and slip out. It’s important for a dog to wear a separate collar with identification when using a slip lead if this is your daily leash. </p>\n<h3>Retractable Leashes</h3>\n<p>A retractable leash is made of the plastic handle that allows a thin length of cord to wraps around a spring-loaded device housed inside. It works similar to the measuring tapes. A button on the handle controls the amount of cord that extends. </p>\n<p>I always will tell you to throw the Flexi line in the bin and get a standard good leash and it will serve you well in all situations. Why would you have a leash at which your dog can pull? So not only he is leading you but your dog also learns leash = pulling and be the leader. This might be worse leash you could own honestly. Sorry if someone’s feelings are hurt, but there is no grey zone with dogs. </p>\n<h2>The 4 Best Dog Leashes In 2020 - What Should You Buy?</h2>\n<h3>Standard Leash - The Julius K9 Super Grip</h3>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/6priOWDXMR5j3xgtIrdBVA/edbff99630e8d6a463e1ff6d02f64421/standard_julius-k9.jpg\" alt=\"standard julius-k9\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<ul>\n<li>Made from strong and durable but comfortable to hold material.</li>\n<li>Easy to hold and it will not become slippery when wet.</li>\n<li>Rubber threads are woven into the material to ensure an optimal.</li>\n<li>Available in a range of lengths, with or without handle, and in various colors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x3C;a href=‘<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2nqIB9g\">https://amzn.to/2nqIB9g</a>' target='_blank' rel='noopener nofollow' class='btn btn__primary’>Click Here To Buy</a></p>\n<h2>Tow Leash - Vivifying Dog Training Lead</h2>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/6iA2kxA8YfHdHFTHDQ0bB4/21f1b7dbc60d71e1f409025dd31a1394/tow_line_1.jpg\" alt=\"tow line 1\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<ul>\n<li>Made from strong nylon and durable metal hook, this dog training leash is durable and for heavy-duty use.</li>\n<li>This leash features a soft padded handle and makes it feel good in the hand.</li>\n<li>The 20ft (6m) leash is used for helping you train the recall of your dog without the dog running off.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x3C;a href=‘<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2o1qLK3\">https://amzn.to/2o1qLK3</a>' target='_blank' rel='noopener nofollow' class='btn btn__primary’>Click Here To Buy</a></p>\n<h2>Adjustable Leash - Dogs My Love 6-Way European Multi-Functional Dog Leash</h2>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/7GAM5vPkgst9oRfTZ8A9cH/faa3c09d404ca67c4eaafb8705835089/adjustable_leash.jpg\" alt=\"adjustable leash\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-function dog leash.
