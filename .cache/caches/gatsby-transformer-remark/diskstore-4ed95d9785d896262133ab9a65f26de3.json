Fish and Meat are both protein-rich sources but they both contain different nutrients.</p>\n<p>Some dog food brands also add additional carbohydrates to their dog food. Most dogs will digest these carbohydrates good when cooked but proteins and fats are their natural diet.</p>\n<p>So how do you know which high-protein dog food to choose for your pooch? Well before we get there it’s important to understand what sources are rich in proteins, healthy for your dog and why your dog might (might not) need protein-rich food.</p>\n<h2>What Has The Most Protein?</h2>\n<p>We first want to tell you a bit about protein-rich sources. The four grouped sources below are the ones with the highest concentration in proteins. In the next section, we have a few of these protein-rich sources but there are more like greek yogurt, broccoli, lentils, etc.</p>\n<p>Some of these protein-rich sources will have better nutrients than others, in the list below we have the best sources for your pooch.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Some dog foods contain egg inside but you can always mix a boiled egg under the food and most dogs will love them.</li>\n<li><strong>Fish:</strong> Some brands sell food that has some source of fish, the most commonly used fish in these foods is salmon because salmon contains a very high omega-3 fatty acid. Omega-3 helps prevent kidney diseases, arthritis, and high cholesterol.</li>\n<li><strong>Meat:</strong> Is the most natural source of proteins for your furry friend. The most common meats you will find in dog food are beef, turkey, chicken, duck, and venison.</li>\n<li><strong>Cheese:</strong> It sounds weird but cheese also contains a lot of proteins. When feeding your dog a cheese-based food it’s important to watch the amount of fat. Some cheeses contain more fat than others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some brands will add multiple protein sources to their food. These sources should be listed first on the ingredients list. Most of the proteins should come from chicken, salmon, beef or any other kind of meat.</p>\n<p>As you will see in the next section there are differences in the type of meat used in dog food. In general, it shouldn’t be a problem which source is used for proteins unless your dog has an allergic reaction, when this happens it’s important to talk to your vet to figure out which source created the reaction.</p>\n<h2>Protein-Rich Sources For Dogs</h2>\n<p>We made a list with some protein-rich sources for your dog. Each protein source has different nutrients as you can see, that is good for your dog’s health. It’s important to keep in mind that not every dog is created equally, therefore your dog might need more or fewer proteins.</p>\n<h3>Hard-Boiled Egg (50 grams)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbs:</strong> 0.6 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Fat:</strong> 5.3 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Protein:</strong> 6.3 grams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Egg also contains <strong>Vitamin A, Vitamin B2 (riboflavin), Vitamin B12 (cobalamin), Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), Phosphorus:</strong> 86mg and <strong>Selenium:</strong> 15.4 mcg.</p>\n<h3>Almonds (28 grams)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbs:</strong> 0 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Fat:</strong> 14 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Protein:</strong> 6 grams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Almonds also contain <strong>Vitamin E, Manganese</strong>and <strong>Magnesium.</strong></p>\n<h3>Chicken Breast (172 grams)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbs:</strong>0 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Fat:</strong> 6.2 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Protein:</strong> 53.4 grams.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cottage Cheese (226 grams)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbs:</strong> 6.1 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Fat:</strong> 2.3 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Protein:</strong> 28 grams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cottage Cheese also contains <strong>Phosphorus, Sodium, Selenium, Vitamin B12, Riboflavin, Calcium,</strong>and <strong>Folate.</strong></p>\n<h3>Skyr (170 grams)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbs:</strong> 7 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Fat:</strong> 0 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Protein:</strong> 19 grams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Skyr also contains <strong>Phosphorus, Calcium, Riboflavin, Vitamin B-12, and Potassium.</strong></p>\n<h3>Broccoli (91 grams)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbs:</strong>6 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Fat:</strong>0.4 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Protein:</strong>2.5 grams.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Beef (100 grams)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbs:</strong> 0 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Fat:</strong> 11.8 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Protein:</strong> 26.1 grams.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Salmon (124 grams)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbs:</strong>0 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Fat:</strong>5.5 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Protein:</strong>31.7 grams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Salmon also contains <strong>Sodium:</strong>107 mg and <strong>Potassium:</strong>513.36 mg.</p>\n<h3>Turkey (100 grams)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carbs:</strong>0 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Fat:</strong> 3.2 grams.</li>\n<li><strong>Protein:</strong> 29.9 grams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Turkey also contains <strong>Omega-3:</strong> 70 mg, <strong>Omega-6:</strong> 570 mg, <strong>Vitamin B3, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B12, Vitamin B1</strong>and <strong>Folate.</strong></p>\n<p>As you can see some vegetables also contain proteins and are completely safe to feed your dog. Dogs can eat these protein sources, but keep in mind that the dog’s digestive system is built different and might not extract the nutrients they need from it.</p>\n<p>Therefore we recommend to go with a meat-based diet, if you, for some reason, decide to feed your pooch vegetarian it’s really important for your dog’s health to check him regularly, muscles, bones, skin, coat, and blood. Your dog might need extra supplements because the vegetarian meal doesn’t digest and provide enough nutrients.</p>\n<p>The information gathered in the table comes from  <a href=\"https://healthline.com/\">healthline.com</a>  if you have a source in mind to feed your dog you can always check their site for nutrition facts about the source.</p>\n<h2>Does My Dog Benefit From A High Protein Food?</h2>\n<p>As with humans, dogs that are active need more proteins for better muscle, tissue and organ development. The normal average healthy dog needs 1.7 grams of proteins per 1 kg of body weight. That means a dog that weighs 27 kg should get 45.9 grams of proteins.\nWhen your dog is more active it burns more calories meaning you should feed your dog extra proteins and fats to keep his body healthy.</p>\n<p>What’s an active dog you might ask. Mostly active dogs are the ones used in dog sports. We made a list for you to see if your dog belongs to the active dog group or not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Police Dogs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Military K9s</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Search and Rescue Dogs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Herding Dogs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Guard Dogs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Tracking Dogs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Hunting Dogs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Agility Dogs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Canicross Dogs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Disc Dogs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Pregnant Dogs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Nursing Dogs</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The list contains some of the most common sports a dog can do, but when your dog goes running / biking with you, your dog might also need more proteins.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t sure if your dog needs extra proteins it’s always a good idea to ask your veterinarian to test the blood.</p>\n<h2>Medical Concerns of High-Protein Dog Food</h2>\n<p>Most dogs will handle a high-protein diet perfectly, but some dogs can better avoid a lot of proteins.</p>\n<p>There is a chance your dog might have an allergy for some protein sources, but this doesn’t mean that your dog has to avoid proteins. Dogs with kidney problems better avoid high protein foods. If you’re not sure if your dog has any of these medical conditions you should ask your vet to test the blood.</p>\n<p>Recent research shows that healthy older dogs need more proteins than healthy younger dogs because their metabolic-rate is slower than that of younger dogs.</p>\n<p>Signs that your dog doesn’t get enough proteins or has an improper protein to calorie ratio may include any or all of the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Growth Rate in puppies</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Anemia</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Weight Loss</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Skeletal muscle atrophy</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Dull unkempt hair coat</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Anorexia</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Reproductive problems</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Persistent unresponsive parasitism or low-grade microbial infection</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Rapid weight loss after injury or during disease</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Failure to respond properly to the treatment of injury or disease</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any or all of these signs are visible to your dog call a vet and have him/her checked. Don’t try to solve this yourself as you might damage your dog’s health in the process.</p>\n<h2>What Makes A Good High-Protein Dog Food?</h2>\n<p>There are no real guidelines that can be used to label high-protein dog food. But the AAFCO published a  <a href=\"https://www.merckvetmanual.com/management-and-nutrition/nutrition-small-animals/nutritional-requirements-and-related-diseases-of-small-animals\">nutrient requirement</a>  that states:</p>\n<p>The dietary requirement for protein in healthy adult dogs is satisfied when the dog’s metabolic need for amino acids and nitrogen is satisfied. Optimal diets for growing puppies should contain a minimum of 22% protein as dry matter (AAFCO guidelines) or 45 g protein/1,000 kcal ME for puppies 4–14 wk old and 35 g protein/1,000 kcal ME for puppies >14 wk old (NRC guidelines). Adult dogs require a minimum of 18% protein as dry matter (AAFCO guidelines) or ~20 g protein/1,000 kcal of ME required (NRC guidelines).</p>\n<p><em>The AAFCO</em></p>\n<p>This means that dog foods that exceed these levels are high-protein dog foods. But you are not there just yet! Some suggest that high-protein dog food should contain less than 43% carbohydrates and have at least 30% protein.</p>\n<p>When reading the labels you will also notice a moisture % in your dog food. This gives you the wrong impression of the actual amount of proteins in the food.</p>\n<p>It’s important to find the dry matter basis (DMB) for the dog food.</p>\n<p>To do this you can use the following formula:</p>\n<p><strong>Protein % / (100 % – moisture %) x 100 = Dry Matter Basis (Protein) %</strong>\nAn example would be:\n34% / (100% – 10%) x 100 = 37.7%</p>\n<p>You can use this formula to calculate any DMB% in your dog food, but in this case, we are talking about proteins so we gave the example to calculate the DMB(P).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}
