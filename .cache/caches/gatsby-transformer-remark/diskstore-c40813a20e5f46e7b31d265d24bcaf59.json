This is will be another influencing detail when choosing the size of the crate.</p>\n<p>One very good accessory for a crate is the crate cover. Crate covers have the benefit of providing a more den-like feeling, since the crate is less exposed on three sides and allows your dog to actually enjoy being in his own cozy, safe little hideaway and will often choose to go there for naps, to chew on his favorite toy, or to get away from the noise/fuss of visitors, etc.</p>\n<p>The crate must have a fixed spot in your house. This spot must not be an isolated spot from the rest of the house, because this will give the dog the message that crating is negative since he/she will be isolated far away from the loved ones. At the same time, the spot should not be in a busy, noisy kitchen either. If it is too noisy the dog can’t find peace and quiet for his/her nappies and recharge.</p>\n<h2>Dog Crate Sizes</h2>\n<h3>Extra Small</h3>\n<p>This crate size is usable for dogs that will grow as high as about 22in (56cm).

Wire crates are bulky and not adapted to a car’s design, so most probably will not fit in a regular, medium-sized car.</p>\n<h3>Soft-Sided Dog Crate</h3>\n<p>This type of dog kennel isn’t for every dog. They are usually made of canvas or nylon and are therefore more destructible than wire or plastic crates. They’re also more difficult to clean, can be easy for curious pups to escape from, or destructive animals to chew through.</p>\n<p>But there are also several pros for soft-sided crates: they’re lightweight, great for travel, and can be stored easily.</p>\n<h3>Heavy-Duty Dog Crate</h3>\n<p>This type of crate is commonly marketed for giant breed dogs, dogs who destroy their crates, or for master crate escape artists.</p>\n<p>The con of this type of crate is the price mainly, but it pays off if this is the only way to keep your puppy safe.</p>\n<h3>Furniture Dog Crates</h3>\n<p>Also known as fashion crates, the wood or rattan finish of these crates certainly looks the best of all these options around the house, and some can even double as a side table, being somewhat functional too.</p>\n<p>The downside is that these are not suitable for destructive dogs.</p>\n<h2>Our Top 4 Picks</h2>\n<h2>Basic Wire Crate - AmazonBasics Single Door &#x26; Double Door Folding Metal Dog Crate</h2>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/TN4FbHD2ucY6D6VCOMFo4/c8093b948dcdf2a10e487ab298cfb4dd/basic-wire-crate-amazonbasics-single-door-double-door-folding-metal-dog-crate.jpg\" alt=\"basic-wire-double-door-folding-metal-dog-crate\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<ul>\n<li>Dog crate with double-door design for convenient front and side entry.</li>\n<li>Two slide-bolt door latches for increased safety and security.</li>\n<li>Folds flat for easy storage/portability with sturdy metal construction.</li>\n<li>Designed with mini dividers (.81 cm between each bar) on the bottom perimeter to prevent paws from slipping through.</li>\n<li>Optional divider panel and removable composite plastic pan included.</li>\n<li>Available in various sizes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LTuC5H\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"btn btn__primary\">Check Price On Amazon</a></p>\n<h2>Soft-Sided Dog Crate - EliteField 3-Door Folding Soft Dog Crate</h2>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/3LvSnMdm4HQ9GDbn11hYax/493ec8b857e85b37bf62e88d359e6591/soft-sided-dog-crate-elitefield-3-door-folding-soft-dog-crate.jpg\" alt=\"soft-sided-dog-crate-elitefield-3-door-folding-soft-dog-crate\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<ul>\n<li>The crate frame is made of strong steel tube; the crate cover is made of high quality durable 600D fabric and hex mesh fabric; a well ventilated, stylish, lightweight and durable crate.</li>\n<li>Three mesh doors (on the top, front, and side) for convenience and for sunlight and breathability; two accessory pockets on the top and side; removable and washable cover and bed.</li>\n<li>Free carrying bag and fleece bed included; a handle and hand carrying straps on the crate, hand carrying straps and adjustable padded shoulder strap on the carrying bag allow for many carrying options; folded crate with just 3” height for easy transport and storage.</li>\n<li>Available in different sizes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/35abjfV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"btn btn__primary\">Check Price On Amazon</a></p>\n<h2>Heavy-Duty Dog Crate - LUCKUP Heavy Duty Strong Metal Crate</h2>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/rwkkq3td27jd/1Ndyu4TUFn6HUfEk5bDVSi/06dc561935b02b52d48f053dc226369e/heavy-duty-dog-crate-luckup-heavy-duty-strong-metal-crate.jpg\" alt=\"heavy-duty-dog-crate-luckup-heavy-duty-strong-metal-crate\" class=\"post__content--image-full post__content--image-center\"/>\n<ul>\n<li>Heavy-duty frame: made from rust and corrosion-resistant steel, strong and durable, hard to be damaged, nontoxic finished surface keeps your dog healthy and render excellent anti-rust ability.</li>\n<li>Suitable for most medium and large dogs, it has two locks with the safety buckles to prevent the dogs from opening the door and escaping.</li>\n<li>Double door &#x26; locking caster design: a front door and a top door.</li>\n<li>It comes with 360 degrees rotated locking casters that can help you to move the crate anywhere easily and lock the wheels to keep the crate in place.</li>\n<li>Easy to assemble: all hardware pack included, just need to fit it with four wheels and eight screw bolts, locks were pre-assembled.
