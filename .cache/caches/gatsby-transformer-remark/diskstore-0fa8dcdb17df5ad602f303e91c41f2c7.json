With some dogs, it will take a small tuning here and there and then it runs like clockwork, and with some dogs, you will be correcting and working with them for their entire lifetime. </p>\n<p>Be mindful of this and learn to accept the kind of dog you have. The dog is not a machine thus it will never ever be perfect and you are not perfect either. </p>\n<h1>Aggression: is it good, bad or natural?</h1>\n<p>If you look up the definition of aggression you will find the following: “feelings of anger or antipathy resulting in hostile or violent behavior; readiness to attack or confront.” </p>\n<p>Aggressive behavior can cause physical and/or emotional harm to other beings.\nSo reading my statement above you would think aggression = bad. Well not quite. There are different types of aggression and arguably some state that without aggression a race (human or animal) would not have survived. </p>\n<p><strong>AGGRESSION IS A NATURAL BEHAVIOUR AND AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR INSURING THE SURVIVAL.</strong></p>\n<p>When, for example, your dog reacts aggressively towards a foreign dog that enters its territory, by no means is your dog aggressive. This is a natural and instinctual behavior towards survival that the dog displays. It is up to you, as its owner, to teach the dog the society’s rules you expect him to follow and exhibit. </p>\n<p>A dog will utilize aggression only if necessary and not because it is it’s favorite pastime. I believe the “Schutzhund” training is not a training to satisfy the dog’s aggressions need. Aggression is not like hunger or thirst. It doesn’t need to be satisfied in that manner. </p>\n<h1>Aggressive Behaviour Examples</h1>\n<p>Noncontact Behavior: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixation of another dog</li>\n<li>Laying down in a hunting position</li>\n<li>Cutting off the path of another dog </li>\n<li>Growling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contact Behavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rumbling</li>\n<li>Nipping</li>\n<li>Bitting</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Leash Aggression</h1>\n<p>We talk about leash aggression when a dog shows signs of aggression mainly against another dog, during the period of being on the leash. </p>\n<p>Be aware that some dogs will only behave aggressively as long as they are on a leash.  The moment they are off-leash all seems to be solved, but do not be fooled. It does not mean that the problem the dog has, does not exist anymore when it is off-leash. The dog will just solve its issues differently. Maybe the behavior of the dog changes when the leash is released, but not the attitude it has.</p>\n<h1>On and Off-Leash Etiquette</h1>\n<p>To those people that are super proud of their off-leashed dogs and are stunned by others that do leash their dogs and shout out “ my dog just wants to play” or “ my dog is harmless”: good for you! Not all dogs are the same and if the other person is leashing their dog than be respectful and responsible and do the same. Not the dog owner with the leashed dog has a misbehaved dog, but the one that doesn’t leash the dog.</p>\n<p>Just because your dog is playful and harmless doesn’t mean that the other dog is and wants to do the same things. You don’t go for coffee with everybody either.\nJust because your dog is playful and harmless doesn’t mean that it is true. More often owners don’t know what their dog is doing and what signals the dog is giving to the other dog.</p>\n<p>A dog that does not want to play with others and even reacts dismissively and aggressively does not have a behavior problem, but it is rather a natural dog that just likes to be left alone. You don’t allow everybody on the street to hug you either.\nIn the next blog, I will lead you through the root causes of aggressive dog behavior to give you a better understanding of why a dog does what it does.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}
