Yes, but before you start feeding your dog everyday fish, read this article first.</p>\n<h2>Is Fish Good for Dogs?</h2>\n<p>Fish is a healthy protein and can carry many nutrients that are beneficial to a dog’s diet. Being rich with <strong>Omega-3 fatty acids</strong> fish has benefits linked to the immune system, anti-inflammatory properties, as well it helps to heal sore, flaky, damaged or itchy skin.</p>\n<p><strong>The real advantage to fish in your dog’s diet though is its ability to provide many good nutrients without the increased risk of weight gain or a protein overload.</strong> It is also welcomed by dogs that can not eat another type of protein due to intolerance.</p>\n<h2>Is Fish Good for Older Dogs?</h2>\n<p>Fish is a great way to provide your dog with protein without bringing an extra burden on his digestive system if your older dog developed an intolerance towards red meat.</p>\n<h2>Best Types of Fish for Dogs</h2>\n<p>There is a lot of fish in the sea, as the saying goes, but are they all suitable for your dog? With so many fish to choose from, it is better to be safe than sorry. The best types of fish for dogs are the short-lived fish species like salmon, ocean whitefish, lake whitefish, herring, walleye, flounder, and Arctic char.</p>\n<h2>Risks of Feeding Fish to Dogs</h2>\n<p>Longer-lived fish species like tuna and swordfish can contain heavy metals like mercury. Mercury builds up over time in the dog’s system and can lead to heavy metal toxicity. The biggest risk of feeding fish to dogs is the fish bones.</p>\n<h2>Can Dogs Eat Fish Bones?</h2>\n<p>Definitely NO. Fishbones are small, brittle and completely dangerous since they can get stuck in the dog’s mouth, throat, stomach and/or intestines and cause choking or holes in the organ’s walls leading to injuries or even death.</p>\n<h2>Can Dogs Eat Raw Fish?</h2>\n<p>Just like with raw chicken, raw fish can be carrying harmful bacteria like salmonella. This can make you and your dog sick.</p>\n<h2>How Much Fish Can a Dog Eat?</h2>\n<p>Plain, cooked, steamed, or grilled fish is fine for dogs to eat in moderation. A balanced meal for your puppy is not made of fish every day.</p>\n<h2>How Should Fish for Dogs Be Prepared?</h2>\n<p>There are many ways to cook fish for dogs. Just be sure to cook it thoroughly, without seasoning. Grilling or steaming are both good ways to prepare fish since they don’t require oil or butter that can add unnecessary calories and fat.</p>\n<h2>Can Dogs Eat Fish Skin?</h2>\n<p>Sure!
