And that visit will certainly come when your new puppy is at home, “maternity visit”.</p>\n<p>That is great fun, but how you approach it when your puppy is 8 weeks old lays the foundation for how your dog behaves towards visitors once he has grown up.</p>\n<p>Most people do not want their dog to jump up against the visitors, and most visitors do not like it when your dog jumps against them wearing their neat clothes.</p>\n<p>Although most visitors will say the first two months when your puppy is still small that they do not mind it, even then it is still important to stick to how you want your puppy to behave.</p>\n<p>Your puppy can learn this later on in life to of course, but that is not entirely fair to your dog. It causes confusion as something that was always allowed suddenly is no longer allowed.</p>\n<p>Make friends and family clear before you come in what you expect from them. It is terribly difficult to do that when a lovely, lively and enthusiastic puppy comes running towards you. Nobody can resist that, so clarity in advance is best.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to train your new puppy in showing the wanted behaviour. The first way is with a leash and the second you use a bench.</p>\n<p>Whichever is easier for you, you should use but both need to be followed exactly, no matter if the visit is expected or unexpected, first your puppy then your visitors.</p>\n<h2>The Leash Way</h2>\n<p>If you want your puppy to learn to stay on the ground with four feet when letting in and greeting visitors?</p>\n<p><em><strong>You can go through the following steps to reach this goal.</strong></em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make a note on the door with the text: <strong>I’m training the dog, please wait, I’ll be right there.</strong> Like to immediately walk inside when the door opens.</li>\n<li>Make sure there is a pot with super tasty rewards near the front or back door, sofa and the kitchen table.</li>\n<li>Put your puppy on the leash or lift it under her arm. The dog leash is preferred.</li>\n<li>Walk to the door and grab the reward.</li>\n<li>Open the door and just look at your puppy!</li>\n<li>Give the little reward to your puppy while your visit arrives. Your visit must be a moment of attention to the pup.</li>\n<li>When your visit is in, you also take your puppy inside. You let your puppy sit if that goes already. If this does not work yet, hold him tightly on his harness or collar and give a reward if he stays calm.</li>\n<li>When people are allowed to greet you give your puppy permission before your puppy can say hello. Make sure your visit is small to say hello so that your puppy does not have to jump.</li>\n<li>After greeting you, you lure your puppy away with a reward. In this way you teach your puppy that greeting takes a while and that comes with you, away from people, which yields goodies.</li>\n<li>Give your puppy some treats to chew on or lay your puppy in the run with some treats. Visitors are not allowed to interfere with the pup. It will then become the most normal thing for your puppy to grab his treats and lie down.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You repeat this recipe every time a visitor arrives. Don’t let your visit make your puppy crazy, because that’s probably not what you want him to do later when he grows up.</p>\n<p>Walk quietly to the front door, let visitors come in undisturbed and then say hello quietly is a nice greeting for both people and dogs. No jump and hassle, that’s not necessary.</p>\n<h2>The Bench Way</h2>\n<p>If you do not find it convenient to take your puppy to the door, then using a bench, run or even a connecting door to the corridor is an option. In this case you can do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Makes a note on the door with the text: <strong>“I’m training the dog, please wait, I’ll be right there.”</strong> In this case, your visit does not have to enter immediately, so it does not have to be on the note.</li>\n<li>In this case you provide a pot with tasty rewards close to the front or back door, the couch and the kitchen.</li>\n<li>Place your puppy in the bench or run, preferably before the doorbell rings. If the doorbell rings before your puppy is in the bench or run, take the time to put your puppy in the bench or run (if you do well you have a note hanging on the door). At the moment you say quietly “place” and give some treats in the bench or run.</li>\n<li>Now walk quietly to the door and let your visit in.</li>\n<li>When letting in your visit, explain that you would like them to initially leave your puppy alone. Do not ask your visitor to walk to the puppy, not to make eye contact with him or to enter into a conversation at a distance.</li>\n<li>Drop a reward in the bench or run when your visit is in and stay close to the bench or run. You regularly drop a small reward or give it to your puppy through the bars.</li>\n<li>When your visit has quietly taken place on the couch and your puppy has also chosen to lie down or sit quietly in the bench, it is time to let your puppy out off the bench or run. You can do this on a leash, but you can also walk along with the pup to the visit without a leash. Lifting is also an option but not advisable.</li>\n<li>Hold your puppy calmly and let the visit say hello one by one in a calm way. Meanwhile, you reward your puppy with tasty food for four legs on the floor. You can guide this by gently holding onto the harness or collar.</li>\n<li>After the greeting, your puppy will get a tasty bone to play with. Visitors are not allowed to interfere with the pup for a moment, so it will become the most normal thing in the world for your pup to take a bone and start chewing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Repeat this list the next time so that your puppy learns how to deal with visitors. This way you can prevent your puppy from learning to jump.</p>\n<p>A nice side effect of using a bench or run is that your puppy learns to go to his place when the bell rings. That ensures peace for you, your puppy and your visit, not a circus when the doorbell rings.</p>\n<p>If there is an unexpected visit, always take the time for your puppy. Your puppy will learn through repetition and success. Investing the first few months in the behaviour you want will pay you back when your puppy is an adult.</p>\n<p>Your visitors will have to wait at the door for a second, and they will appreciate if they can come and visit you during the rainy season for a cup of tea or coffee, without getting muddy feet on their clothes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!
