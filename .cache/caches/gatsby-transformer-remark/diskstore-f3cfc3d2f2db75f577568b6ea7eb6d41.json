If your puppy gets tired, it’s time to stop the activity that you are doing.</p>\n<p>The processing of stimuli is mainly done during sleep. To be able to dose properly your puppy’s training it is therefore important that you recognise the fatigue signals of your young dog.</p>\n<p>There are several things that you can see when a puppy gets tired. Mimic is one of them.\nIf you look at the face of your puppy, you can look at the eyes, ears and mouth.</p>\n<h2>The Mouth</h2>\n<p>When we start with the mouth then you can notice that a puppy is starting to get tired or starts getting warm because because of the panting. </p>\n<p>The mouth opens slightly with the corners of the mouth pulled slightly backwards.\nOn the mouth you can notice even more fatigue. The puppy will bite harder or more when he gets tired. All pups bite, but when a pup gets tired, the intensity and frequency can increase.</p>\n<h2>The Ears</h2>\n<p>You can also read a lot of information on the ears of your puppy. Tired puppies let their ears hang slightly on the side of their head.</p>\n<p>This happens with hanging ears as well as with standing ears. The ears then seem to hang a little ‘Half stick’.</p>\n<h2>The Eyes</h2>\n<p>Puppy’s eyes always provide information. When tired, the eyes may turn a little red.\nThe lower eyelids of the dogs that are looser in their skin can hang down a bit (especially with the larger breeds).</p>\n<p>The look of a puppy will change. When a puppy realises that he is tired and he is able to find its peace, you will see that it has half closed eyes.</p>\n<h2>Eye Bags</h2>\n<p>Another clear signal on your dog’s face is the appearance of “eye bags”. These bags are lines under the eyes that are about halfway between the eyes and the mouth.\nThese are veins that fill because the corners of the mouth are pulled slightly backwards. These lines form with fatigue, stress and heat.</p>\n<p>With a puppy you see these lines appear quite quickly when you play with him or when he is in a new environment.</p>\n<h2>The Crazy Five Minutes</h2>\n<p>Everyone knows this one. It is that moment when puppies and adult dogs start running in a frenetic manner. Many puppies also add a lot of biting and often they are not accountable for their behaviour at that time.</p>\n<p>There is usually a fixed period of time on the day in which this happens, and that is usually the end of the afternoon or the beginning of the evening. A whole day has already passed for the puppy: walked several times, did some exercises, played, chewed and maybe made a socialisation trip or had a visit.</p>\n<p>After such a full day, it may happen that your puppy is extremely tired, but is unable to realise that he should go to sleep.</p>\n<p>Or he does not have the peace to go to sleep because he is so busy in his head.\nThe puppy can then go wild and be frenetic running around the garden or from one room to another or chase his own tail. The crazy five minutes or the zoomies.\nAt the end of this crazy five minutes the puppy eventually falls asleep, but often it happens that the puppy in the middle of the game with someone in the house becomes too frenetic and starts biting too hard.</p>\n<p>The puppy is tired, stressed or super excited and as he shows, he is unable to calm himself in that situation. The best solution is, after the zoomies moment passed, is to ensure that your puppy is put in his bench or his bed for a while so that he can find the peace and quiet to sleep.</p>\n<p>In the bench or the bed you can put some safe toys that the pup can bite or chew on to get rid of the tension.\nIf no further attention is paid to the puppy, it usually falls asleep within a couple of minutes.</p>\n<h3>What To Do When You See One Of These Signals</h3>\n<p>If you see one or more of these signals, then your puppy is ready for a nap!\nIf the puppy does not get any moments of rest or if he cannot take a rest himself, it is important to give him structured rest moments.</p>\n<p>This can be achieved in a bench or in a room where there is little activity and external stimulation so that the puppy will fall asleep. </p>\n<p>If you continue to play when the puppy is already tired, then the game can degenerate and the chances are you end a game in a negative manner, enabling “bad” memories to the puppy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knowledge Makes You and Your Dog Happy!\nFurry Canine Team</p>\n</blockquote>"}
